  abstract = "One important aspect of episodic memory is the ability to remember the order in which events occurred. Memory for sequences in rats and has been shown to rely on the hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex (DeVito and Eichenbaum (2011) J Neuro 31:3169-3175; Fortin et al. (2002) Nat Neuro 5:458-462). Rats with hippocampal lesions were impaired in selecting the odor that had appeared earlier in a sequence of five odors but were not impaired in recognition of previously sampled odors (Fortin et al., 2002; Kesner et al. (2002) Behav Neuro 116:286-290). These results suggest that order is not represented by relative familiarity or memory strength. However, the cognitive mechanisms underlying memory for order have not been determined. We presented monkeys with lists of five images drawn randomly from a pool of 6,000 images. At test, two images were presented and monkeys were rewarded for selecting the image that had appeared earlier in the studied list. Monkeys learned to discriminate the order of the images, even those that were consecutive in the studied list. In subsequent experiments, we found that discrimination of order was not controlled by list position or relative memory strength. Instead, monkeys used temporal order, a mechanism that appears to encode order of occurrence relative to other events, rather than in absolute time. We found that number of intervening images, rather than passage of time per se, most strongly determined the discriminability of order of occurrence. Better specifying the cognitive mechanisms nonhuman primates use to remember the order of events enhances this animal model of episodic memory, and may further inform our understanding of the functions of the hippocampus.",

Although Semon's contributions were largely ignored in his lifetime, new technologies that allow researchers to image and manipulate the brain at the level of individual neurons has reinvigorated engram research. We review recent progress in studying engrams, including an evaluation of evidence for the existence of engrams, the importance of intrinsic excitability and synaptic plasticity in engrams, and the lifetime of an engram.

Using two-photon calcium imaging, we monitored the activity of LC-CA1 fibers in the mouse dorsal HPC. We find that the LC-CA1 projection signals the translocation of a reward, predicting behavioral performance on a goal-oriented spatial learning task. An optogenetic stimulation mimicking this LC-CA1 activity induces place cell reorganization around a familiar reward, while its inhibition decreases the degree of overrepresentation around a translocated reward. Our results show that LC acts in conjunction with other factors to induce goal-directed reorganization of HPC representations and provide a better understanding of the role of neuromodulatory actions on HPC place map plasticity.",

  abstract = "Parietal cortex comprises several distinct areas. Neurons in each area are selective for particular stimulus dimensions and particular regions of space. The representation of space in a given area reflects a particular motor output by which a stimulus can be acquired. Neurons in the lateral intraparietal area (LIP) are active in relation to both visual and motor events. LIP neurons do not transmit an unambiguous saccadic command. Rather, they signal the location at which an event has occurred. These spatial locations are encoded in oculocentric coordinates, that is, with respect to the current or anticipated position of the center of gaze. When an eye movement brings the spatial location of a recently flashed stimulus into the receptive field of an LIP neuron, the neuron responds to the memory trace of that stimulus. This result indicates that, for nearly all LIP neurons, stored visual information is remapped in conjunction with saccades. Remapping of the memory trace maintains the alignment between the current image on the retina and the stored representation in cortex. Further, when an eye movement is about to occur, more than a third of LIP neurons transiently shift the location of their receptive fields. This anticipatory remapping allows the neuron to begin to respond to a visual stimulus even before the saccade is initiated that will bring the stimulus into the fixation-defined receptive field. Both kinds of remapping serve to create a constantly updated representation of stimulus location that is always in terms of distance and direction from the fovea. This oculocentric representation has the advantage that it already matches that known to exist in the frontal eye fields and the superior colliculus, the output targets of LIP, and it does not require further coordinate transformation in order to contribute to spatially accurate behavior. These results indicate that LIP can analyze visual space without ever forming a representation of absolute target position.",

  abstract = "The hippocampus is one of the most studied structures in the human brain and plays a pivotal role in human memory function. Its recognized function is reflected by the presence of an extensive body of neurophysiological, neuropsychological, anatomical and neurocomputational literature that presents basic mechanisms, theoretical models and psychological concepts. However, in the rapidly growing field of hippocampal research, the clinical aspects of diseases that affect the hippocampus are greatly under-represented in current literature, and clinical approaches and concepts are scattered throughout various clinical and basic scientific disciplines. The Clinical Neurobiology of the Hippocampus explores clinical approaches to the range of diseases that affect the hippocampus. It brings together and reviews the common methods, clinical findings, concepts, mechanisms and, where applicable, therapeutic strategies for these clinical approaches. The clinical spectrum of hippocampal dysfunction encompasses a wide range of neurological, behavioural and psychiatric symptoms and surpasses the ability to encode, store and retrieve information. The relevance of hippocampal involvement in clinical diseases goes beyond mere neuropsychological deficits and includes psychopathological states in various conditions, such as acute amnesic syndromes, Alzheimer's disease, temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), sleep, stroke medicine, limbic encephalitis, neurodevelopmental disorders, stress- and trauma-related disorders, depression, and schizophrenia. The first part of the book covers the basic and integrative features of the hippocampus, such as the anatomy and imaging of this structure, and the basic mechanisms of hippocampal function, including the principles of hippocampus-dependent memory processing in amnesia and sleep, the mechanisms of vulnerability and adult neurogenesis as well as the effects of stress. The second part covers the various clinical manifestations in which the hippocampus is involved and in which the preceding basic mechanisms are reflected. Bringing together a broad team of experts on the basic and clinical aspects of the hippocampus, the book provides an integrative view of the hippocampus. It is invaluable for neurologists, neuroscientists, and psychiatrists, and will stimulate interdisciplinary discussions in clinical neuroscience.",

Recent studies have revealed circuit mechanisms in the PRC for the retrieval of cue-associated information, and have demonstrated that, in monkeys, PRC neuron-encoded information can be behaviourally read out. These studies, among others, support the theory that the PRC converts visual representations of an object into those of its associated features and initiates backward-propagating, interareal signalling for retrieval of nested associations of object features that, combined, extensionally represent the object meaning. I propose that the PRC works as the ventromedial hub of a 'two-hub model' at an apex of the hierarchy of a distributed memory network and integrates signals encoded in other downstream cortical areas that support diverse aspects of knowledge about an object.",

However, in the real world there are strong associations and regularities in the input. In an information theoretic sense, regularities introduce redundancies that make the input more compressible. The current study shows that observers can take advantage of these redundancies, enabling them to remember more items in working memory. In 2 experiments, covariance was introduced between colors in a display so that over trials some color pairs were more likely to appear than other color pairs. Observers remembered more items from these displays than from displays where the colors were paired randomly. The improved memory performance cannot be explained by simply guessing the high-probability color pair, suggesting that observers formed more efficient representations to remember more items. Further, as observers learned the regularities, their working memory performance improved in a way that is quantitatively predicted by a Bayesian learning model and optimal encoding scheme. These results suggest that the underlying capacity of the individuals' working memory is unchanged, but the information they have to remember can be encoded in a more compressed fashion.",

We propose a new more quantitatively precise conception of chunk derived from the notion of Kolmogorov complexity and compressibility: a chunk is a unit in a maximally compressed code. We present a series of experiments in which we manipulated the compressibility of stimulus sequences by introducing sequential patterns of variable length. Our subjects' measured digit span (raw short term memory capacity) consistently depended on the length of the pattern after compression, that is, the number of distinct sequences it contained. The true limit appears to be about 3 or 4 distinct chunks, consistent with many modern studies, but also equivalent to about 7 uncompressed items of typical compressibility, consistent with Miller's famous magical number.",

Here we propose an alternative hypothesis that does not entail any increase in the number of individuated representations stored online. Instead, familiar ensembles of items may be attached to a content-free label (e.g., remembering red-white-blue as ``American flag'') that can be used to retrieve the constituents of a chunk when they are needed to guide a response. If accessing ``compressed'' memories requires an additional retrieval process, then access to compressed items should be slower than for uncompressed items. Indeed, Experiments 1 (visual) and 2 (verbal) showed that response times were substantially longer in patterned (i.e., compressed) than in control conditions. In Experiments 3 and 4, regularity-based advantages were eliminated with brief (1000 or 875 ms) response deadlines, in line with our hypothesis that accessing compressed memories requires a slow retrieval process. In sum, while statistical regularities can enable access to larger amounts of information, this information may not be available ``online'' in the same way as singleton items.",

Prior knowledge in long-term memory can aid in efficient encoding of information by allowing for the prioritization of novel stimuli over familiar ones. Here we used a full-report procedure in a visual working memory paradigm, where participants reported the location of six colored circles in any order, to examine the influence of prior information on resource allocation in working memory. Participants learned that one of the items appeared in a restricted range of locations, whereas the remaining items could appear in any location. We found that participants' memory performance benefited from learning this prior information. Specifically, response precision increased for all items when prior information was available for one of the items. Responses for both familiar and novel items were systematically ordered from highest to lowest precision. Participants tended to report the familiar item in the second half of the six responses and did so with greater precision than for novel items. Moreover, novel items that appeared near the center of the prior location were reported with worse precision than novel items that appeared elsewhere. This shows that people strategically allocated working memory resources by ignoring information that appeared in predictable locations and prioritizing the encoding of information that appeared in unpredictable locations. Together these findings demonstrate that people rely on long-term memory not only for remembering familiar items, but also for the strategic allocation of their limited capacity working memory resources.",

Previously, we have shown that these receptive field properties may be accounted for in terms of a strategy for producing a sparse distribution of output activity in response to natural images. Here, in addition to describing this work in a more expansive fashion, we examine the neurobiological implications of sparse coding. Of particular interest is the case when the code is overcomplete--i.e., when the number of code elements is greater than the effective dimensionality of the input space. Because the basis functions are non-orthogonal and not linearly independent of each other, sparsifying the code will recruit only those basis functions necessary for representing a given input, and so the input-output function will deviate from being purely linear. These deviations from linearity provide a potential explanation for the weak forms of non-linearity observed in the response properties of cortical simple cells, and they further make predictions about the expected interactions among units in response to naturalistic stimuli.",

Neural probability functions prepared either by computing the probability of criterion response or by integrating receiver operating characteristics to yield the probability of correct choice in a two-alternative forced-choice situation resemble psychometric functions obtained in psychophysical and behavioral experiments on humans and animals, but are shallower in slope. The slopes of neuronal probability functions are slightly higher when they are estimated over short time periods, but even so do not equal the slopes measured psychophysically in human and monkey observers.

The results appeared to provide the first clear-cut evidence in the monkey of the essential role of the hippocampus in spatial memory, but that interpretation neglected the inclusion in the lesion of the underlying posterior parahippocampal region. To determine the separate contributions of the hippocampus and posterior parahippocampal region to these spatial forms of one-trial memory, we trained 10 rhesus monkeys, as before, to remember the spatial positions of either two different trial-unique objects overlying two of the wells in a three-well test tray (object-place trials) or simply two of the three wells (place trials). Six of the monkeys then received ibotenic acid lesions restricted to the hippocampal formation (group H), and the four others received selective ablations of the posterior parahippocampal region (group P), comprising mainly parahippocampal cortex, parasubiculum, and presubiculum. Group H was found to be completely unaffected postoperatively on both types of trials, whereas group P sustained an impairment on both types equal in magnitude to that observed after the combined lesions in the original studies. Thus, contrary to the previous interpretation, one-trial memory for object-place association and, perhaps more fundamentally, one-trial memory for two different places appear to be critically dependent not on the hippocampal formation but rather on the posterior parahippocampal region.",

  journal = "eLife",
  abstract = "Many decisions are expressed as a preference for one item over another. When these items are familiar, it is often assumed that the decision maker assigns a value to each of the items and chooses the item with the highest value. These values may be imperfectly recalled, but are assumed to be stable over the course of an interview or psychological experiment. Choices that are inconsistent with a stated valuation are thought to occur because of unspecified noise that corrupts the neural representation of value. Assuming that the noise is uncorrelated over time, the pattern of choices and response times in value-based decisions are modeled within the framework of Bounded Evidence Accumulation (BEA), similar to that used in perceptual decision-making. In BEA, noisy evidence samples accumulate over time until the accumulated evidence for one of the options reaches a threshold. Here, we argue that the assumption of temporally uncorrelated noise, while reasonable for perceptual decisions, is not reasonable for value-based decisions. Subjective values depend on the internal state of the decision maker, including their desires, needs, priorities, attentional state, and goals. These internal states may change over time, or undergo revaluation, as will the subjective values. We reasoned that these hypothetical value changes should be detectable in the pattern of choices made over a sequence of decisions. We reanalyzed data from a well-studied task in which participants were presented with pairs of snacks and asked to choose the one they preferred. Using a novel algorithm ( Reval ), we show that the subjective value of the items changes significantly during a short experimental session (about 1 hour). Values derived with Reval explain choice and response time better than explicitly stated values. They also better explain the BOLD signal in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, known to represent the value of decision alternatives. Revaluation is also observed in a BEA model in which successive evidence samples are not assumed to be independent. We argue that revaluation is a consequence of the process by which values are constructed during deliberation to resolve preference choices.",

However, the neural circuit mechanisms underlying persistent neuronal encoding within this network remain unresolved. Here, we ask how neural circuits support persistent activity by examining population recordings from posterior parietal (PPC) and prefrontal (PFC) cortices in two male monkeys that performed spatial and motion direction-based tasks that required working memory. While spatially selective persistent activity was observed in both areas, robust selective persistent activity for motion direction was only observed in PFC. Crucially, we find that this difference between mnemonic encoding in PPC and PFC is associated with the presence of functional clustering: PPC and PFC neurons up to ∼700 μm apart preferred similar spatial locations, and PFC neurons up to ∼700 μm apart preferred similar motion directions. In contrast, motion-direction tuning similarity between nearby PPC neurons was much weaker and decayed rapidly beyond ∼200 μm. We also observed a similar association between persistent activity and functional clustering in trained recurrent neural network models embedded with a columnar topology. These results suggest that functional clustering facilitates mnemonic encoding of sensory information.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Working memory refers to our ability to temporarily store and manipulate information. Numerous studies have observed that, during working memory, neurons in higher cortical areas, such as the parietal and prefrontal cortices, mnemonically encode the remembered stimulus. However, several recent studies have failed to observe mnemonic encoding during working memory, raising the question as to why mnemonic encoding is observed during some, but not all, conditions. In this study, we show that mnemonic encoding occurs when a cortical area is organized such that nearby neurons preferentially respond to the same stimulus. This result provides plausible neuronal conditions that allow for mnemonic encoding, and gives us further understanding of the brain's mechanisms that support working memory.",

In such representations, uncertainty information is explicitly represented at all stages of processing, including early sensory areas, allowing for flexible and efficient computations in a wide variety of situations. Next, we critically review neural and behavioral evidence about the representation of uncertainty in the brain agreeing with fully Bayesian representations.

Uncertainty could lead individuals to more likely seek one of these information types. Extant research informs both predictions about and empirical work exploring this question. This review covers relevant cognitive literature and then suggests empirical approaches to better understand information-seeking actions triggered by uncertainty. Notably, we propose that examining continuous navigation data can provide important insights into information seeking. Benefits of continuous data will be elaborated through one paradigm, spatial reorientation, which intentionally induces uncertainty through disorientation and cue conflict.

Furthermore, during learning, neural activity conveyed the direction of the animals' impending responses progressively earlier within each successive trial. The final level of activity just before the response, however, was unaffected by learning.

Consistent with the central premise of standard consolidation theory (SCT), a memory is initially hippocampus-dependent but, over time, it undergoes a consolidation process and eventually becoming represented in a distributed cortical network independent of the hippocampus. In this paper, we review evidence that is incompatible with each of the following essential features of SCT that are derived from its central premise: (1) Hippocampal damage reliably produces temporally graded retrograde amnesia, (2) all declarative explicit memories are equivalent with respect to consolidation, (3) consolidation entails a process of duplication in which a particular cortically based memory is identical to the hippocampus-dependent memory from which it derived, (4) consolidated memories are permanent and immutable. We propose an alternative hypothesis that assumes a transformation process and changes in the memory over time. Building on multiple trace theory (Nadel \& Moscovitch, 1997), the transformation hypothesis contains three key elements that differentiate it from SCT: (1) An initially formed memory, which is assumed to be episodic and context-bound, remains dependent on the hippocampus for as long as it is available, (2) with time and experience, a hippocampal memory supports the development, in neocortex, of a less integrated, schematic version, which retains the gist of the original memory, but few of its contextual details, (3) there is a dynamic interplay between the two types of memory such that one or another may be dominant, depending on the circumstances at retrieval. Evidence is provided in support of the transformation hypothesis, which is advanced as a framework for unifying the seemingly disparate results of studies of anterograde and retrograde memory in the animal and human literatures.",

Here we report that such activity encompasses a set of dynamically switching cortical states, many of which correspond closely to orientation maps. When such an orientation state emerged spontaneously, it spanned several hypercolumns and was often followed by a state corresponding to a proximal orientation. We suggest that dynamically switching cortical states could represent the brain's internal context, and therefore reflect or influence memory, perception and behaviour.",

These efforts have been motivated by the belief that similar synaptic modifications occur during memory formation, but it has never been shown that learning actually induces LTP in CA1. We found that one-trial inhibitory avoidance learning in rats produced the same changes in hippocampal glutamate receptors as induction of LTP with HFS and caused a spatially restricted increase in the amplitude of evoked synaptic transmission in CA1 in vivo. Because the learning-induced synaptic potentiation occluded HFS-induced LTP, we conclude that inhibitory avoidance training induces LTP in CA1.",

  abstract = "Functional neuroimaging studies have shown that different cognitive functions activate overlapping brain regions. An activation overlap may occur because a region is involved in operations tapped by different cognitive functions or because the activated area comprises subregions differentially involved in each of the functions. To investigate these issues, we directly compared brain activity during episodic retrieval (ER) and working memory (WM) using event-related functional MRI (fMRI). ER was investigated with a word recognition test, and WM was investigated with a word delayed-response test. Two-phase trials distinguished between retrieval mode and cue-specific aspects of ER, as well as between encoding/maintenance and retrieval aspects of WM. The results revealed a common fronto-parieto-cerebellar network for ER and WM, as well as subregions differentially involved in each function. Specifically, there were two main findings. First, the results differentiated common and specific subregions within the prefrontal cortex: (i) left dorsolateral areas were recruited by both functions, possibly reflecting monitoring operations; (ii) bilateral anterior and ventrolateral areas were more activated during ER than during WM, possibly reflecting retrieval mode and cue-specific ER operations, respectively; and (iii) left posterior/ventral (Broca's area) and bilateral posterior/dorsal areas were more activated during WM than during ER, possibly reflecting phonological and generic WM operations, respectively. Second, hippocampal and parahippocampal regions were activated not only for ER but also for WM. This result suggests that indexing operations mediated by the medial temporal lobes apply to both long-term and short-term memory traces. Overall, our results show that direct cross-function comparisons are critical to understand the role of different brain regions in various cognitive functions.",

Here we introduce a machine learning model called a differentiable neural computer (DNC), which consists of a neural network that can read from and write to an external memory matrix, analogous to the random-access memory in a conventional computer. Like a conventional computer, it can use its memory to represent and manipulate complex data structures, but, like a neural network, it can learn to do so from data. When trained with supervised learning, we demonstrate that a DNC can successfully answer synthetic questions designed to emulate reasoning and inference problems in natural language. We show that it can learn tasks such as finding the shortest path between specified points and inferring the missing links in randomly generated graphs, and then generalize these tasks to specific graphs such as transport networks and family trees. When trained with reinforcement learning, a DNC can complete a moving blocks puzzle in which changing goals are specified by sequences of symbols. Taken together, our results demonstrate that DNCs have the capacity to solve complex, structured tasks that are inaccessible to neural networks without external read–write memory. A ‘differentiable neural computer’ is introduced that combines the learning capabilities of a neural network with an external memory analogous to the random-access memory in a conventional computer. Conventional computer algorithms can process extremely large and complex data structures such as the worldwide web or social networks, but they must be programmed manually by humans. Neural networks can learn from examples to recognize complex patterns, but they cannot easily parse and organize complex data structures. Now Alex Graves, Greg Wayne and colleagues have developed a hybrid learning machine, called a differentiable neural computer (DNC), that is composed of a neural network that can read from and write to an external memory structure analogous to the random-access memory in a conventional computer. The DNC can thus learn to plan routes on the London Underground, and to achieve goals in a block puzzle, merely by trial and error—without prior knowledge or ad hoc programming for such tasks.",

In each experiment, we identified a cluster of LIP cells with overlapping response fields (RFs) and sustained activity during memory-guided saccades. Microstimulation of this cluster caused an increase in the proportion of choices toward the RF of the stimulated neurons. Choices toward the stimulated RF were faster with microstimulation, while choices in the opposite direction were slower. Microstimulation never directly evoked saccades, nor did it change reaction times in a simple saccade task. These results demonstrate that the discharge of LIP neurons is causally related to decision formation in the discrimination task.",

It has been hypothesized that engrams for a specific memory are distributed among multiple brain regions that are functionally connected. Here, we report the hitherto most extensive engram map for contextual fear memory by characterizing activity-tagged neurons in 409 regions using SHIELD-based tissue phenotyping. The mapping was aided by a novel engram index, which identified cFos+ brain regions holding engrams with a high probability. Optogenetic manipulations confirmed previously known engrams and revealed new engrams. Many of these engram holding-regions were functionally connected to the CA1 or amygdala engrams. Simultaneous chemogenetic reactivation of multiple engrams, which mimics natural memory recall, conferred a greater level of memory recall than reactivation of a single engram ensemble. Overall, our study supports the hypothesis that a memory is stored in functionally connected engrams distributed across multiple brain regions.",

Second, that different forms of memory representation are supported by distinct brain pathways with circuitry and neural coding properties. Third, that the contributions of different brain systems can be compared and contrasted by distinguishing between dedicated (or specific) and elaborate (or general) memory systems. A primary goal of this work is to relate the neurobiological properties of dedicated and elaborate systems to their neuropsychological counterparts, and in so doing, account for the phenomenology of memory, from conditioning to conscious recollection.",

Comparable studies in nonhuman primates, however, are few, and findings are often contradictory.

For this experiment, six adult monkeys received bilateral hippocampal ibotenic acid lesions, and six control subjects underwent sham surgery. Freely moving monkeys then foraged for food located in two arrays of three distinct locations among 18 locations distributed in an open-field arena. Multiple goals and four pseudorandomly chosen entrance points precluded the monkeys' ability to rely on an egocentric strategy to identify food locations. Monkeys were tested in two conditions. First, local visual cues marked the food locations. Second, no local cues marked the food locations, so that monkeys had to rely on an allocentric (spatial relational) representation of the environment to discriminate these locations. Both hippocampal-lesioned and control monkeys discriminated the food locations in the presence of local cues. However, in the absence of local cues, control subjects discriminated the food locations, whereas hippocampal-lesioned monkeys were unable to do so. Interestingly, histological analysis of the brain of one control monkey whose behavior was identical to that of the experimentally lesioned animals revealed a bilateral ischemic lesion restricted to the hippocampus. These findings demonstrate that the adult monkey hippocampal formation is critical for the establishment or use of allocentric spatial representations and that selective damage of the hippocampus prevents spatial relational learning in adult nonhuman primates.",

This lesion, which includes the hippocampal formation, amygdala, and adjacent cortex, including the parahippocampal gyrus (the H+A+ lesion), appears to constitute an animal model of human medial temporal lobe amnesia. Reexamination of histological material from previously studied monkeys with H+A+ lesions indicated that the perirhinal cortex had also sustained significant damage. Furthermore, recent neuroanatomical studies show that the perirhinal cortex and the closely associated parahippocampal cortex provide the major source of cortical input to the hippocampal formation. Based on these 2 findings, we evaluated the severity of memory impairment in a group of monkeys that received bilateral lesions limited to the perirhinal cortex and parahippocampal gyrus (the PRPH lesion). The performance of the PRPH group was compared with that of monkeys with H+A+ lesions, who had been studied previously, and with a group of normal monkeys. Monkeys with PRPH lesions were severely impaired on 3 amnesia-sensitive tasks: delayed nonmatching to sample, object retention, and 8-pair concurrent discrimination. On pattern discrimination, a task analogous to ones that amnesic patients perform well, monkeys in the PRPH group performed normally. Overall, monkeys with PRPH lesions were as impaired or more impaired than the comparison group of monkeys with H+A+ lesions. These and other recent findings (Zola-Morgan et al., 1989b) suggest that the severe memory impairment in monkeys and humans associated with bilateral medial temporal lesions results from damage to the hippocampal formation and adjacent, anatomically related cortex, not from conjoint hippocampus-amygdala damage.",

We used a virtual reality task in which animals selected one of the two targets in the arms of the maze, according to a learned context-color rule. Our results show that during associative learning, HPC principal cells concentrate spikes in bursts, enabling temporal summation and fast synaptic plasticity in small populations of neurons and ultimately facilitating rapid encoding of associative memories.

The latter would facilitate broadcasting of signals loaded in short-term memory across neuronal populations without necessarily triggering fast synaptic plasticity.",

Computer systems obtain significant robustness to noise by approximating analogue quantities with discrete digital representations. In a similar manner, theoretical models of persistent activity in spiking neurons have shown that the most robust and stable way to store the short-term memory of a continuous parameter is to approximate it with a discrete representation. This general idea applies very broadly to mechanisms that range from biochemical networks to single cells and to large circuits of neurons. Second, why is it commonly observed that persistent activity in the cortex can be strongly time-varying? This observation is almost ubiquitous, and therefore must be taken into account in our models and our understanding of how short-term memories are held in the cortex.",

Item information underlies the memory for individual items or events, and associative information allows one to relate or associate 2 separate items or events. The troublesome findings are the differential forgetting of item and associative information (item recognition falls off over retention intervals, whereas associative information does not) and the differential emphasis results (greater attention to items hurts pair recognition, but greater attention to pairs does not affect item recognition). The addition of context and mediators enables TODAM to account for these interactions. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)",

The current study used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to directly compare whether these PFC regions show selective activation associated with one memory domain. In a within-subjects design, subjects performed the n-back WM task (two-back condition) as well as LTM encoding (intentional memorization) and retrieval (yes-no recognition) tasks. Additionally, each task was performed with two different types of stimulus materials (familiar words, unfamiliar faces) in order to determine the influence of material-type vs task-type. A bilateral region of dorsolateral PFC (DL-PFC; BA 46/9) was found to be selectively activated during the two-back condition, consistent with a hypothesized role for this region in active maintenance and/or manipulation of information in WM. Left frontopolar PFC (FP-PFC) was also found to be selectively engaged during the two-back. Although FP-PFC activity has been previously associated with retrieval from LTM, no frontopolar regions were found to be selectively engaged by retrieval. Finally, lateralized ventrolateral PFC (VL-PFC) regions were found to be selectively engaged by material-type, but uninfluenced by task-type. These results highlight the importance of examining PFC activity across multiple memory domains, both for functionally differentiating PFC regions (e.g., task-selectivity vs material-selectivity in DL-PFC and VL-PFC) and for testing the applicability of memory domain-specific theories (e.g., FP-PFC in LTM retrieval).",

Attention is assumed to play an important role in working memory (WM) which is also essential for conscious awareness. Different people approaching WM from different orientations tend to conceptualize WM in somewhat different ways. Dual-task methodology can be used with considerable flexibility across a wide range of paradigms and practical situations. Dual-task methods have been used widely and productively in analysing a broad nature of a range of complex tasks. Neuropsychology has played a crucial role in developing the model and in particular in separating the influence of the visuospatial and phonological subsystems. Early findings showed that the word length effect in verbal short-term memory extends throughout childhood, there being a striking linear relationship between amount recalled and speech rate. The main use of computational modelling has concerned the phonological loop. It seems clear that interference effects play an important role in forgetting, as reflected in the effect of similarity and on the impact of exceeding the capacity of one or more components of WM.

Because their backgrounds were so different from the cultural context of the story, the subjects changed details in the story that they could not understand. Besides containing important seminal concepts, Remembering is fascinating from an historical perspective. Bartlett discusses the ideas and research of Ebbinghaus, Freud, Jung, and Spearman. In addition, his comparison of Swazi African culture and British culture is a study in cross-cultural psychology that was ahead of its time.",

In addition, this method allowed us to directly observe the shift from working memory to long-term memory representations controlling attention as learning occurred and experience accrued searching for the same target object.

A key feature of working memory is its starkly limited capacity, such that only a few simple items can be remembered at once. Prior work has shown that this capacity limit cannot be circumvented by providing additional encoding time, whether providing just 200 ms or up to 1300 ms, capacity is still limited to only three to four items. In contrast, Brady et al. (2016) hypothesized that real-world objects, but not simple items used in prior research, benefit from additional encoding time and are not subject to traditional capacity limits. They supported this hypothesis with results from both behavior and the contralateral delay activity (CDA), an EEG marker of working memory storage, and concluded that familiar, complex stimuli are necessary to observe encoding time effects. Here, we conducted three replications of Brady et al.'s key manipulation with a larger number of human participants and more trials per condition. We failed to replicate their primary behavioral result (objects benefit more than colors from additional encoding time) and failed to observe an object-specific increase in the CDA. Instead, we found that encoding time benefitted both simple color items and real-world objects, in contrast to both the findings by Brady et al., and some prior work on this topic. Overall, we observed no support for the hypothesis that real-world objects have a different capacity than colored squares. We discuss the implications of our findings for theories of visual working memory (VWM).",

Central to this capacity is the ability to form high-level, abstract representations that take advantage of regularities in the world to support generalization1. However, little is known about how these representations are encoded in populations of neurons, how they emerge through learning and how they relate to behaviour2,3. Here we characterized the representational geometry of populations of neurons (single units) recorded in the hippocampus, amygdala, medial frontal cortex and ventral temporal cortex of neurosurgical patients performing an inferential reasoning task. We found that only the neural representations formed in the hippocampus simultaneously encode several task variables in an abstract, or disentangled, format. This representational geometry is uniquely observed after patients learn to perform inference, and consists of disentangled directly observable and discovered latent task variables. Learning to perform inference by trial and error or through verbal instructions led to the formation of hippocampal representations with similar geometric properties. The observed relation between representational format and inference behaviour suggests that abstract and disentangled representational geometries are important for complex cognition. A task in which participants learned to perform inference led to the formation of hippocampal representations whose geometric properties reflected the latent structure of the task, indicating that abstract or disentangled neural representations are important for complex cognition.",

Like ASWM, EM relies on rapid synaptic modification that is also activity silent; however, while ASWM posits transient synaptic modifications, EM traces persist over longer time periods.

Damage to the dorsal striatum impaired acquisition of the win-stay task but not the win-shift or CCP tasks. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the mammalian brain may be capable of acquiring different kinds of information with different, more-or-less independent neural systems. A neural system that includes the hippocampus may acquire information about the relationships among stimuli and events. A neural system that includes the amygdala may mediate the rapid acquisition of behaviors based on biologically significant events with affective properties.

  abstract = "The memory for where in the environment a particular visual stimulus has been seen is one of the types of memory relatively specifically impaired by hippocampal damage in primates including man. In order to investigate what processing might be performed by the hippocampus related to this type of memory, the activity of hippocampal neurons was recorded while monkeys performed an object-place memory task. In this task, the monkey was shown a sample stimulus in one position on a video screen, there was a delay of 2 s, and then the same or a different stimulus was shown in the same or in a different position. The monkey remembered the sample and its position, and if both matched the delayed stimulus, he licked to obtain fruit juice. Of the 600 neurons analysed in this task, 3.8\% responded differently for the different spatial positions, with some of these responding differentially during the sample presentation, some in the delay period, and some in the match period. Thus some hippocampal neurons respond differently for stimuli shown in different positions in space, and some respond differently when the monkey is remembering different positions in space. In addition some of the neurons responded to a combination of object and place information, in that they responded only to a novel object in a particular place. These neuronal responses were not due to any response being made or prepared by the monkey, for information about which behavioral response was required was not available until the match stimulus was shown. This is the first demonstration that some hippocampal neurons in the primate have activity related to the spatial position of stimuli. The activity of these neurons was also measured in a delayed spatial response task, in which the monkey was shown a stimulus in one position, and, after a 2 s delay when two identical stimuli were shown, had to reach to touch the stimulus which was in the position in which it had previously been seen. It was found that the majority of the neurons which responded in the object-place memory task did not respond in the delayed response task. Instead, a different population of neurons (5.7\% of the total) responded in the delayed spatial response task, with differential left-right responses in the sample, delay, or match periods.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

  abstract = "Monkeys with conjoint bilateral lesions of the hippocampus and amygdala were impaired on four different tests of memory (delayed retention of object discriminations, concurrent discrimination, delayed response, and delayed nonmatching to sample). Because tests involving delays and distractions are known to be especially sensitive to human amnesia, in three of the tasks relatively long delay intervals between training and test trials were used, and in two tasks distraction was introduced during the delay intervals. The severity of the impairment increased with the length of the delay, and distraction markedly increased the memory impairment. For one task given on two occasions (delayed nonmatching to sample), the severity of the impairment was unchanged over a period of 1.5 years. Taken together with previous findings that skill learning is unimpaired in the same operated monkeys, the results of the present study strengthen the conclusion that monkeys with medial temporal lesions constitute an animal model of human amnesia. In addition, the four tasks used here appear to constitute a sensitive and appropriate battery that could be used in other studies of the neuroanatomy of memory functions in the monkey.",

  abstract = "Rats with damage to the fimbria-fornix were tested for the post-operative retention of a preoperatively learned discrimination on a radial arm maze. The maze contained two sets of arms. One set, which never had food on them, comprised the “reference memory” task. The correct response on every approach to each arm in this unbaited set was to refrain from entering it. A second set of arms, each of which had one pellet of food on it at the beginning of a test, comprised the “working memory” task. The correct response to each of the arms in this baited set changed during a test. On the first approach to each of them, the correct response was to run down the arm and obtain the food there; on all subsequent approaches the correct response was to refrain from running down the arm because the food was no longer available. At the end of postoperative testing, performance on the reference memory task was normal, while performance on the working memory task was severely impaired by large lesions and slightly impaired by small ones. Rats with the most complete fimbria-fornix lesions showed no signs of improvement in working memory. This behavioural dissociation suggests a differential involvement of the hippocampus in working memory as compared to reference memory.On a testé des rats avec lésion de la fimbria et du fornix sur la rétention post-opératoire d'une discrimination de labyrinthe à branches radiales apprise pré-opératoirement. Le labyrinthe comportait 2 séries de branches. Une série sur laquelle on ne mettait jamais de nourriture représentait une épreuve de “mémoire de référence”. La réponse correcte dans cette série pour toute approche à chaque branche était de ne pas y pénétrer. Une second série de branches dont chacune avait au début du test un morceau de nourriture représentait la tâche de “mémoire de travail”. La réponse correcte à chacune des branches dans cette série changeait au cours du test. A la premiére approche de chacune des branches, la réponse correcte était de parcourir toute la branche pour obtenir la nourriture. A toutes les approches suivantes, la réponse correcte était de ne pas y pénétrer puisqu'il n'y avait plus de nourriture. A la fin du test post-opératoire, les performances sur la tâche de “mémoire de référence” étaient normales tandis que les performences sur la tâche de “mémoire de travail” étaient gravement perturbées par les grandes lésions et légèrement perturbées par les petites lésions. Chez les rats avec lésions fimbria-fornix les plus complétes, on ne constatait aucun signe d'amélioration dans la “mémoire de travail”. Ces dissociations comportementales suggèrent une implication différente de l'hippocampe dans la “mémoire de travail” et dans la “mémoire de référence”.Ratten mit Schädigung der Fimbriae des Fornix wurden auf das postoperative Gedächtnis für ein präoperativ erlerntes Diskriminationsmuster getestet.

Einer davon enthielt niemals Futter, er wurde als Test für ein “reference”-Gedächtnis angesehen. Das richtige Verhalten bei jedem Versuch bestand darin, in diesem nicht mit Futter versehenen Bereich nicht einzutreten. Eine zweite Anordnung von Gängen, die jeweils bei Testbeginn Futter enthielt, wurde als “working”-Gedächtnis betrachtet. Das korrekte Verhalten in jedem dieser Gänge in diesem Bereich wechselte während des Testversuchs. Beim ersten Versuch bestand die korrekte Antwort darin, in den Gang zu laufen, in dem sich das Futter befand. In allen nachfolgenden Versuchen war es korrekt, nicht dorthin zu laufen, weil nun das Futter nicht mehr zur Verfügung stand. Bei Ende der Untersuchung, nach Durchführung der Operation, erwies sich, daβ das “reference”-Gedächtnis unbeeinträchtigt geblieben war, während das “working”-Gedächtnis bei ausgedehnten Läsionen stark gelitten hatte, bei leichteren Schäden geringer. Dieses unterschiedliche Verhalten spricht dafür, daβ der Hippocampus in verschiedener Weise in die Gedächtnisfunktionen einbezogen ist.",

Five experiments are reported in which the properties and limits of cued recall were explored. Certain qualitative differences in the performance of amnesic subjects compared with control subjects were obtained. First, the phenomenon of differential efficacy of cued recall in amnesic subjects has been replicated. Second, restricting the number of response alternatives is more effective in amnesic subjects than normal subjects. Third, some evidence for enhanced effects of prior learning on retention has been shown in the amnesic subjects. These findings are incompatible with an interpretation in terms of a failure of consolidation, but are compatible with one that attaches importance to interference phenomena in the amnesic syndrome.Les sujets amnesiques peuvent montrer une rétention normale du materiel verbal s'ils utilisent une technique de rappel avec repère.

Primarily on the basis of features observed in Nissl- and fiber-stained preparations, supplemented with Golgi-stained material and preparations stained for heavy metals by Timm's method and histochemically for acetylcholinesterase, the entorhinal cortex has been divided into seven fields that are named according to their rostrocaudal and mediolateral positions except for one rostrally located field that is named for the prominent input that it receives from the olfactory bulb. At rostral levels, the entorhinal cortex is marked by a number of morphological inhomogeneities. The neurons tend to be organized in patches that are surrounded by large, thick, radially oriented bundles of fibers. At caudal levels, the entorhinal cortex has a more distinctly laminated appearance, reminiscent of that in the neocortex, and most of the neurons and fiber fascicles are arranged in discrete radial columns. The cortical region adjoining the entorhinal cortex laterally, which is commonly known as the ``perirhinal cortex,'' is in fact composed of two separate fields corresponding to areas 35 and 36 of Brodmann. Area 35 occupies the fundus and part of the lateral aspect of the rhinal sulcus. Area 36 extends from the lateral bank of the rhinal sulcus into the inferior temporal gyrus, where it borders fields TA and TE rostrally, and field TF of the parahippocampal gyrus caudally. The surface extents of each of the entorhinal fields have been determined by making ``unfolded'' two-dimensional maps of the region and measuring the areas with a computerized digitizing system.",

  abstract = "The entorhinal cortex of the monkey is commonly viewed as the major link between the cerebral cortex and the other fields of the hippocampal formation. Until recently, however, little was known about the origins of the cortical projections to the entorhinal cortex, and most of the available information is still based on degeneration studies. We have carried out a systematic analysis of these connections by placing small injections of the retrograde tracer wheat germ agglutinin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase into each of the fields of the entorhinal cortex of the Macaca fascicularis monkey. Retrogradely labeled cells were observed in several areas of the frontal and temporal lobes, the insula, and the cingulate cortex. In the frontal lobe, the greatest number of labeled cells were observed in the orbital region and specifically in areas 13 and 13a: labeled cells were also seen in areas 14, 11, and 12. In the dorsolateral frontal cortex, labeled cells were observed mainly in the rostral half of area 46; occasionally cells were also seen in areas 9, 8, and 6. In the cingulate cortex, labeled cells were observed in area 25, area 32, and rostral levels of area 24; fewer cells were observed at caudal levels of area 24 or in area 23. The retrosplenial region (areas 30 and 29), including its caudal extension along the rostral calcarine sulcus and its ventral extension into the temporal lobe, contained numerous labeled cells. In the temporal lobe, retrogradely labeled cells were arranged in two rostrocaudally oriented bands. Rostral to the hippocampal formation, the first band encompassed the piriform and periamygdaloid cortices and areas 35 and 36; the labeling in area 36 was continuous to the temporal pole. At more caudal levels this band was located immediately lateral to the hippocampal formation and included areas 35 and 36 rostrally and areas TH and TF caudally. The second band was situated in the superior temporal gyrus where labeled cells were observed in several distinct cytoarchitectonic fields, including the parainsular cortex in the fundus of the inferior limiting sulcus. In the insula proper, retrogradely labeled cells were seen mainly in the rostral or agranular division; far fewer were observed in the dysgranular and granular insula. Whereas there is little available physiological information concerning many of the cortical regions that project to the entorhinal cortex, on anatomical grounds they may be generally characterized as polysensory associational regions.",

For this purpose, monkeys were prepared with bilateral hippocampectomy combined with unilateral amygdalectomy, and (as a control) bilateral amygdalectomy combined with unilateral hippocampectomy. The animals were trained both before and after surgery on a one-trial visual recognition task requiring memory of single objects for 10 sec each and then given a postoperative performance test in which their one-trial recognition ability was taxed with longer delays (up to 2 min) and longer lists (up to 10 objects). The two groups, which did not differ reliably at any stage, obtained average scores on the performance test 75 and 80\%, respectively. Comparison with the results of an earlier experiment [8] indicates that this performance level lies approximately midway between that of monkeys with amygdaloid or hippocampal removals alone (91\%) and that of monkeys with combined amygdalo-hippocampal removals (60\%). The results point to a direct quantitative relationship between degree of recognition impairment and amount of conjoint damage to the amygdala and hippocampus irrespective of the specific structure involved.

One pair (anterior pair) covered the medial part of the temporal tip (area TG), starting at the rhinal sulcus and extending 3 mm laterally. The second pair (posterior pair) was placed 3 mm lateral to the anterior pair, covering the rest of TG and the anterior extreme of the inferotemporal gyri, anterior TE. Cooling either pair of probes produced a deficit at all delays, but the deficit was greater at the longest delays. There was no difference between cooling the anterior pair and cooling the posterior pair except that cooling the anterior pair greatly increased the disruption of recall that is produced by an interfering stimulus. When all four probes were cooled, which suppressed the function of the entire temporal tip, performance dropped to chance at all delays. While under this condition, the animals could not learn new visual discriminations but could perform previously learned visual discriminations. These results are consistent with the suggestion that the temporal pole is the store for the brief anterograde memory that is available to the medial temporal amnesics.",

Studies using this model have identified structures in the medial temporal lobe that are essential for forming long-term memory (i.e. the hippocampus and the entorhinal, perirhinal and parahippocampal cortices). Recently, an important aspect of these studies was questioned by Ringo (Behav. Brain Res., 42 (1991) 123-134). He suggested that the data from the delayed non-matching-to-sample task, which has been extensively used in these studies, have been analyzed in a potentially misleading way. He reanalyzed the data from several laboratories by transforming percent correct data to a discriminability (d') measure based on signal detection theory. In monkeys with lesions, performance appeared to be equivalently impaired at short and long retention delays. He concluded that the data do not support the idea that medial temporal lobe damage produces an impairment in long-term memory, but not short-term memory. However, most of the studies he analyzed were not designed to address the distinction between short-term and long-term memory. We show here that, in studies designed to compare short-term and long-term memory directly, medial temporal lobe lesions impair long-term memory while leaving short-term memory intact. This result is obtained whether the data are analyzed using a percent correct measure, the d' measure, or an arcsine transform.",

In the task, the monkey learned to make one spatial response, touching a screen three times when he saw one visual stimulus on the video monitor, and a different spatial response, of withdrawing his hand from the screen, when a different visual stimulus was shown. Fourteen percent of the neurons fired differentially to one or the other of the stimulus-spatial response associations. The mean latency of these differential responses was 154 +/- 44 (SD) ms. The firing of these neurons was shown to reflect a combination of the particular stimulus and the particular response associated by learning in the stimulus-response association task and could not be accounted for by the motor requirements of the task, nor wholly the stimulus aspects of the task, as demonstrated by testing their firing in related visual discrimination tasks. Responsive neurons were found throughout the hippocampal formation, but were particularly concentrated in the subicular complex and the CA3 subfield. These results show that single hippocampal neurons respond to combinations of the visual stimuli and the spatial responses with which they must become associated in conditional spatial response tasks and are consistent with the suggestion that part of the mechanism of this learning involves associations between visual stimuli and spatial responses learned by single hippocampal neurons.",

  abstract = "Monkeys with lateral prefrontal lesions which spared the ventrolateral cortex relearned object alternation to a level of 80 per cent correct, although others with the same lesion failed to relearn spatial alternation. Neither form of alternation was relearned by monkeys with orbital removals that included the ventrolateral cortex. The results suggest that the classical delayed alternation deficit produced by an extensive prefrontal removal is compounded of two separate defects: one attributable to dorsolateral damage, and related to the spatial factor in the test; the other due to ventral damage and related to the reversal factor.Des singes avec lésions préfrontales épargnant le cortex ventrolatéral réapprenaient une tâche d'alternance poui objet à un niveau de succès de 80\%, tandis que d'autres avec la même lésion échouaient à réapprendre une tâche d'alternance spatiale. Aucune forme de tâche d'alternance n'était réapprise par les singes avec résection orbitaire comprenant le cortex ventrolatéral. Ces résultats suggèrent que les déficits classiques d'alternance, déterminés par une ablation pré-frontale large, sont en fait composés de deux déficits séparés: l'un attribuable à une atteinte dorso-latérale et en relation avec un facteur spatial dans le test; l'autre dû à une atteinte ventrale et en relation avec un facteur de renversement.Affen mit lateralen praefrontalen Läsionen, die den ventrolateralen Cortex verschonten, lernten, einen Objektwechsel bis zu 80\% wieder richtig zu erkennen, während andere mit denselben Läsionen das Erfassen eines räumlichen Wechsels nicht wiedererlernten.

This habit became severely disturbed following bilateral ablation of medial precruciate cortex (which was originally regarded as a part of the premotor area) and the animals exhibited marked ``magneto-reactions'' during the early post-operative period which only declined gradually during post-operative training. The magneto reaction which was expressed by the subject's approach to the cue, standing in front of it during its activation and often touching it with the nose, could not be elicited by removal of other cortical areas of the frontal lobes, including the proreal areas. Since ablation of these structures have been found to result in severe impairments by dogs on tasks of delayed response (Eawicka et al. 1966) it (appears that two distinct patterns of behavioral impairments can be related to these two cortical areas in the dogs frontal lobes. In monkeys impairments on delayed response tasks are clearly elicited by ablation of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and especially the segment of sulcus principalis (Mishkin 1957).

Most neurons were also tested on a conventional delayed reaching task, in which they needed to remember one cue position during the delay. Among 72 neurons that exhibited significant delay-period activity, one group of neurons (n = 19) exhibited delay-period activity only when a visual cue was presented at one of the three positions (position-dependent). Of these, 6 neurons exhibited this activity when a cue was presented at that position independent of the temporal order, whereas 13 neurons exhibited this activity only when a cue was presented at that position in a particular temporal order (e.g., as the first cue or the second cue). Another group of neurons (n = 39) exhibited delay-period activity only when visual cues were presented at two positions out of three (pair-dependent). Of these, 7 neurons exhibited pair-dependent activity independent of the temporal order of cue presentation. However, 32 neurons exhibited this activity only when two cues were presented in a particular temporal order. The remaining 11 neurons exhibited non-differential activity during the delay period and 3 neurons exhibited miscellaneous activity. These results show that a single prefrontal neuron can retain information regarding two spatial positions, and that, to retain two spatial positions and the temporal order of cue presentation, new types of delay-period activity emerged; i.e., pair-dependent activity and temporal order-dependent activity. Both types of activity could be a mechanism for simultaneously retaining two items of spatial information and for effectively combining multiple spatial information by a single neuron. In addition, the presence of delay-period activity with position-dependency, pair-dependency and temporal order-dependency suggests that the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex plays an important role in planning sequential behaviors.",

A system that recognizes images must be able to encode a current stimulus, recall the code of a previous stimulus, compare the codes of the two stimuli, and make a decision on the basis of the outcome of the comparison. Therefore, IT neurons must be involved in at least one of these processes. To determine the specific role of IT neurons in visual memory, we measured the information conveyed in the neuronal responses about current patterns, recalled patterns, and behavioral context. 2. Two monkeys were trained to perform a sequential matching task using a set of 32 black and white Walsh patterns. In the course of an experiment, each pattern was presented repeatedly in sample, match, and nonmatch behavioral contexts. While the monkeys were performing the task, we recorded the activity of 76 neurons from area TE of IT. The neuronal responses to the stimuli were converted to spike density functions, and the resultant waveforms were quantified using their principal components. The relationships between the responses and the stimuli were studied using analysis of variance and information theory. 3. The analysis of variance was applied to the neuronal response waveforms using the context (sample, match, or nonmatch) and the patterns of the stimuli as independent variables and the spike count or the coefficients of the principal components as the dependent variables. We found that the waveforms of most neurons were significantly modulated by both the pattern and the context of the stimulus presentation. 4. We also analyzed the stimulus-response relationships using information theory. The input codes were based on the pattern and context of the stimuli, and the output codes were based on the spike count or the principal components of the responses. The neuronal response waveforms were found to convey significant amounts of information about both the pattern and context of the stimuli. Transmitted information was greatest when the response of a neuron was interpreted as a message about the combination of pattern and context. Nevertheless, there was information about context independent of pattern and vice versa. 5. We also used information theory to determine whether the neuronal responses to the second, or test, stimulus conveyed information about the pattern of the first, or sample, stimulus. The input codes were based on the patterns of the sample stimuli, and the output codes were based on the responses to the nonmatch test stimuli.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

We tested whether this behavioral context effect also occurs when the monkey is not executing a Konorski task, i.e. no temporal comparison of stimuli is being performed. Responses of the same IT neurons under two behavioral conditions were compared using the same temporal stimulus sequence (but different stimuli): a Konorski task and a Fixation task. We found that the occurrence of the behavioral context effect did not depend on the execution of the short-term memory task. The observed decline in the level of responses to repeated presentation of similar stimuli is interpreted as being a passive mechanism involved in recency detection, which occurs even if the recency information is not useful for the task.

Adaptation was similar during passive fixation or an attention-demanding task. We found consistent adaptation of spiking activity and LFP power in high- (gamma) but not low-frequency bands when repeating shapes. Contrary to sharpening models, repetition did not affect shape selectivity. The degree of similarity between adapter and test shapes was a stronger determinant of adaptation than was the response to the adapter. Adaptation still occurred when adapter and test stimuli did not spatially overlap, but adaptation was stronger for same, compared with different, adapters and test stimulus positions. These adaptation effects were similar for spiking and for gamma activity. In conclusion, adaptation of IT spiking activity and LFPs in IT is strongly dependent on feature similarities in the adapter and test stimuli, in agreement with input, but not firing-rate fatigue models.",

This age-related volume reduction is paralleled by behavioral and functional deficits in hippocampus-dependent learning and memory tasks. This age-related volume reduction of the hippocampus is not a consequence of an age-related loss of hippocampal neurons. The morphological changes associated with aging include reductions in the branching pattern of dendrites, as well as reductions in spine densities, reductions in the densities of fibers projecting into the hippocampus as well as declines in the rate of neurogenesis. It is very unlikely that a single factor or a single class of molecules is responsible for all these age-related morphological changes in the hippocampus. Nevertheless, it would be of advantage to identify possible neuromodulators or neuropeptides that may contribute to these age-related changes. In this context, growth factors may play an important role in the maintenance of the postnatal hippocampal architecture. In this review it is hypothesized that brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a factor critically involved in the regulation of age-related processes in the hippocampus. Moreover, evidences suggest that disturbances in the BDNF-system also affect hippocampal dysfunctions, as e.g. seen in major depression or in Alzheimer disease.",

They showed that when specific colors are consistently paired together in a WM task, subjects can take optimal advantage of these regularities to recall more colors, an effect they labeled memory compression. They proposed that memory compression is a product of visual statistical learning, an automatic apprehension of statistical regularities that has been shown in prior work to be disconnected from explicit learning. If statistical learning enables an expansion of the number of individuated representations in visual WM, it would require revision of virtually all models of capacity in this online memory system. That said, this provocative claim is inconsistent with multiple studies that have found no improvement in WM performance following numerous repetitions of specific sample displays (e.g., Logie, Brockmole, \& Vandenbroucke, 2009; Olson \& Jiang, 2004). Here, we replicate the Brady et al. (2009) findings but show that memory compression effects were restricted to subjects who had perfect explicit recall of the color pairs at the end of the study, suggesting that statistical regularities boosted performance by enabling contributions from long-term memory. Thus, while memory compression effects provide an interesting example of the tight collaboration between online and offline memory representations, they do not provide evidence that statistical regularities can augment the number of individuated representations that can be concurrently stored in visual WM.

In visual memory, attempts to account for errors in terms of allocation of a limited pool of working memory resources have met with some success, but the biological basis for this cognitive architecture is unclear. An alternative perspective attributes recall errors to noise in tuned populations of neurons that encode stimulus features in spiking activity. I show that errors associated with decreasing signal strength in probabilistically spiking neurons reproduce the pattern of failures in human recall under increasing memory load. In particular, deviations from the normal distribution that are characteristic of working memory errors and have been attributed previously to guesses or variability in precision are shown to arise as a natural consequence of decoding populations of tuned neurons. Observers possess fine control over memory representations and prioritize accurate storage of behaviorally relevant information, at a cost to lower priority stimuli. I show that changing the input drive to neurons encoding a prioritized stimulus biases population activity in a manner that reproduces this empirical tradeoff in memory precision. In a task in which predictive cues indicate stimuli most probable for test, human observers use the cues in an optimal manner to maximize performance, within the constraints imposed by neural noise.",

Most views of chunking assume that when we use chunks, this results in the loss of specific perceptual details, since it is presumed the contents of chunks are decoded from long-term memory rather than reflecting the exact details of the item that was presented. However, in two experiments, we find that in situations where participants make use of chunks to improve visual working memory, access to instance-specific perceptual detail (that cannot be retrieved from long-term memory) increased, rather than decreased. This supports an alternative view: that chunks facilitate the encoding and retention into memory of perceptual details as part of structured, hierarchical memories, rather than serving as mere “content-free” pointers. It also provides a strong contrast to accounts in which working memory capacity is assumed to be exhaustively described by the number of chunks remembered.",

The functional organization of this area has been a matter of debate over a period of decades. Early models proposed segregation of spatial and object information represented in working memory in the dorsal and ventral PFC, respectively. Other models emphasized the integrative ability of the entire PFC depending on task demands, not necessarily tied to working memory. An anterior-posterior hierarchy of specialization has also been speculated, in which progressively more abstract information is represented more anteriorly. Here we revisit this debate, updating these arguments in light of recent evidence in non-human primate neurophysiology studies. We show that spatial selectivity is predominantly represented in the posterior aspect of the dorsal PFC, regardless of training history and task performed. Objects of different features excite both dorsal and ventral prefrontal neurons, however neurons highly specialized for feature information are located predominantly in the posterior aspect of the ventral PFC. In accordance with neuronal selectivity, spatial working memory is primarily impaired by inactivation or lesion of the dorsal PFC and object working memory by ventral inactivation or lesion. Neuronal responses are plastic depending on task training but training too has dissociable effects on ventral and dorsal PFC, with the latter appearing to be more plastic. Despite the absence of an overall topography, evidence exists for the orderly localization of stimulus information at a sub-millimeter scale, within the dimensions of a cortical column. Unresolved questions remain, regarding the existence or not of a functional map at the areal and columnar scale, and the link between behavior and neuronal activity for different prefrontal subdivisions.",

Across 3 experiments, we investigated the extent to which active maintenance in WM can be replaced by relying on information stored in episodic LTM, thereby freeing capacity for additional information in WM. First, participants encoded word pairs into LTM, and then completed a WM task, also involving word pairs. Crucially, the pairs presented in each WM trial comprised varying numbers of new pairs and the previously learned LTM pairs. Experiment 1 showed that recall performance in the WM task was unaffected when memory set size increased through the addition of LTM pairs, but that it deteriorated when set size increased through adding new pairs. In Experiment 2, we investigated the robustness of this effect, orthogonally manipulating the number of new and LTM pairs used in the WM task. When WM load was low, performance declined with the addition of LTM pairs but remained superior to performance with the matched set size comprising only new pairs. By contrast, when WM load was higher, adding LTM pairs did not affect performance. In Experiment 3, we found that the benefit of LTM representations arises from retrieving these during the WM test, leading them to suffer from typical interference effects. We conclude that individuals can outsource workload to LTM to optimize performance, and that the WM system negotiates the exchange of information between WM and LTM depending on the current memory load.

Miller (1956) suggested that the capacity of verbal short-term memory is determined by the number of chunks that can be stored in memory, rather than by the number of items or the amount of information. But how does the improvement due to chunking come about, and is memory really determined by the number of chunks? One possibility is that chunking is a form of data compression. It allows more information to be stored in the available capacity. An alternative is that chunking operates primarily by redintegration. Chunks exist only in long-term memory, and enable the corresponding items in short-term memory to be reconstructed more reliably from a degraded trace. We review the data favoring each of these views and discuss the implications of treating chunking as data compression. Contrary to Miller, we suggest that memory capacity is primarily determined both by the amount of information that can be stored but also by the underlying representational vocabulary of the memory system. Given the limitations on the representations that can be stored in verbal short-term memory, chunking can sometimes allow the information capacity of short-term memory to be exploited more efficiently.

Recall precision was accurately described by the interaction of two independent constraints: an encoding limit that determines the maximum rate at which information can be transferred into memory and a separate storage limit that determines the maximum fidelity with which information can be maintained. Recall variability decreased incrementally with time, consistent with a parallel encoding process in which visual information from multiple objects accumulates simultaneously in working memory. No evidence was observed for a limit on the number of items stored. Cuing one display item with a brief flash led to rapid development of a recall advantage for that item. This advantage was short-lived if the cue was simply a salient visual event but was maintained if it indicated an object of particular relevance to the task. These cuing effects were observed even for items that had already been encoded into memory, indicating that limited memory resources can be rapidly reallocated to prioritize salient or goal-relevant information.",

Selectivity for spatial locations, shapes, and colors was evaluated in six monkeys never trained in working memory tasks, while they viewed the stimuli passively. Recordings from over two thousand neurons revealed systematic differences between anterior and posterior regions. In the dorsal prefrontal cortex, anterior regions exhibited the largest receptive fields, longest response latencies, and lowest amount of information for stimuli. In the ventral prefrontal cortex, posterior regions were characterized by a low percentage of responsive neurons to any stimuli we used, consistent with high specialization for stimulus features. Additionally, spatial information was more prominent in the dorsal and color in ventral regions.

Neural recordings found templates were represented across prefrontal and parietal cortex in a structured manner, such that perceptually neighboring templates had similar neural representations. When the task changed, a new attentional template was learned by incrementally shifting the template towards rewarded features. Finally, we found attentional templates transformed stimulus features into a common value representation that allowed the same decision-making mechanisms to deploy attention, regardless of the identity of the template.

Cognitive maps have been observed in the hippocampus, but their algorithmic form and the processes by which they are learned remain obscure. Here, we employed large-scale, longitudinal two-photon calcium imaging to record activity from thousands of neurons in the CA1 region of the hippocampus while mice learned to efficiently collect rewards from two subtly different versions of linear tracks in virtual reality. The results provide a detailed view of the formation of a cognitive map in the hippocampus. Throughout learning, both the animal behavior and hippocampal neural activity progressed through multiple intermediate stages, gradually revealing improved task understanding and behavioral efficiency. The learning process led to progressive decorrelations in initially similar hippocampal neural activity within and across tracks, ultimately resulting in orthogonalized representations resembling a state machine capturing the inherent structure of the task. We show that a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and a biologically plausible recurrent neural network trained using Hebbian learning can both capture core aspects of the learning dynamics and the orthogonalized representational structure in neural activity. In contrast, we show that gradient-based learning of sequence models such as Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs) and Transformers do not naturally produce such representations. We further demonstrate that mice exhibited adaptive behavior in novel task settings, with neural activity reflecting flexible deployment of the state machine. These findings shed light on the mathematical form of cognitive maps, the learning rules that sculpt them, and the algorithms that promote adaptive behavior in animals. The work thus charts a course toward a deeper understanding of biological intelligence and offers insights toward developing more robust learning algorithms in artificial intelligence.",

In nets of linear neurons, trained with either a Hebbian (purely incremental) or a Stanton and Sejnowski learning rule, sparse coding increases the number of independent associations that can be stored. When neurons are nonlinear, for a diversity of learning rules, sparse coding may result in an increase in the number of patterns that can be discriminated. The analysis is then used to help interpret recent evidence on the encoding of information in the taste and visual systems, as obtained from recordings in primates. Following the taste pathway, it is found that the breadth of tuning of individual neurons becomes progressively finer, consistent with the idea that sparser representations become advantageous as the taste information is eventually associated with that coming from other sensory modalities. In the visual system, considering a population of neurons in the temporal cortex that respond preferentially to faces, it is argued that their breadth of tuning represents a compromise between fully distributed encoding, and a grandmother cell type of encoding, which would result in a given neuron responding only to an individual face.",

Along these lines, a number of studies have attempted to train unsupervised learning algorithms on natural images in the hope of developing receptive fields with similar properties, but none has succeeded in producing a full set that spans the image space and contains all three of the above properties. Here we investigate the proposal that a coding strategy that maximizes sparseness is sufficient to account for these properties. We show that a learning algorithm that attempts to find sparse linear codes for natural scenes will develop a complete family of localized, oriented, bandpass receptive fields, similar to those found in the primary visual cortex.

The theory assumes that the hippocampal region develops new stimulus representations that enhance the discriminability of differentially predictive cues while compressing the representation of redundant cues. Other brain regions, including cerebral and cerebellar cortices, are presumed to use these hippocampal representations to recode their own stimulus representations. In the absence of an intact hippocampal region, the theory implies that other brain regions will attempt to learn associations using previously established fixed representations. Instantiated as a connectionist network model, the theory provides a simple and unified interpretation of the functional role of the hippocampal region in a wide range of conditioning paradigms, including stimulus discrimination, reversal learning, stimulus generalization, latent inhibition, sensory preconditioning, and contextual sensitivity. The theory makes novel predictions regarding the effects of hippocampal lesions on easy-hard transfer and compound preexposure. Several prior qualitative characterizations of hippocampal function--including stimulus selection, chunking, cue configuration, and contextual coding--are identified as task-specific special cases derivable from this more general theory. The theory suggests that a profitable direction for future empirical and theoretical research will be the study of learning tasks in which both intact and lesioned animals exhibit similar initial learning behaviors but differ on subsequent transfer and generalization tasks.",

This motif is shared by other cerebellum-like structures and has inspired numerous theoretical models. Less attention has been paid to structures immediately presynaptic to GrC layers, whose architecture can be described as a 'bottleneck' and whose function is not understood. We therefore develop a theory of cerebellum-like structures in conjunction with their afferent pathways that predicts the role of the pontine relay to cerebellum and the glomerular organization of the insect antennal lobe. We highlight a new computational distinction between clustered and distributed neuronal representations that is reflected in the anatomy of these two brain structures. Our theory also reconciles recent observations of correlated GrC activity with theories of nonlinear mixing. More generally, it shows that structured compression followed by random expansion is an efficient architecture for flexible computation.",

To test the model, we generated novel forms of visual metamers, stimuli that differ physically but look the same. We developed a behavioral protocol that uses metameric stimuli to estimate the receptive field sizes in which the model features are represented. Because receptive field sizes change along the ventral stream, our behavioral results can identify the visual area corresponding to the representation. Measurements in human observers implicate visual area V2, providing a new functional account of neurons in this area. The model also explains deficits of peripheral vision known as crowding, and provides a quantitative framework for assessing the capabilities and limitations of everyday vision.",

In addition, the psychophysical task was tailored in each experiment to the physiological properties of the neuron under study; the visual display was matched to each neuron's preference for size, speed, and direction of motion. Under these conditions, the sensitivity of most MT neurons was very similar to the psychophysical sensitivity of the animal observers. In fact, the responses of single neurons typically provided a satisfactory account of both absolute psychophysical threshold and the shape of the psychometric function relating performance to the strength of the motion signal. Thus, psychophysical decisions in our task are likely to be based upon a relatively small number of neural signals. These signals could be carried by a small number of neurons if the responses of the pooled neurons are statistically independent. Alternatively, the signals may be carried by a much larger pool of neurons if their responses are partially intercorrelated.",

We have now used numerical simulations to try to understand how neural signals in area MT support psychophysical decisions. We developed a model that pools neuronal responses drawn from our physiological data set and compares average responses in different pools to produce psychophysical decisions. The structure of the model allows us to assess the relationship between ``neuronal'' input signals and simulated psychophysical performance using the same methods we have applied to real experimental data. We sought to reconcile three experimental observations: psychophysical performance (threshold sensitivity to motion stimuli embedded in noise), a trial-by-trial covariation between the neural response and the monkey's choices, and a modest correlation between pairs of MT neurons in their variable responses to identical visual stimuli. Our results can be most accurately simulated if psychophysical decisions are based on pools of at least 100 weakly correlated sensory neurons. The neurons composing the pools must include a broader range of sensitivities than we encountered in our MT recordings, presumably because of the inclusion of neurons whose optimal stimulus is different from the one being discriminated. Central sources of noise degrade the signal-to-noise ratio of the pooled signal, but this degradation is relatively small compared with the noise typically carried by single cortical neurons. This suggests that our monkeys base near-threshold psychophysical judgments on signals carried by populations of weakly interacting neurons; these populations include many neurons that are not tuned optimally for the particular stimuli being discriminated.",

  abstract = "Cortical neurons exhibit tremendous variability in the number and temporal distribution of spikes in their discharge patterns. Furthermore, this variability appears to be conserved over large regions of the cerebral cortex, suggesting that it is neither reduced nor expanded from stage to stage within a processing pathway. To investigate the principles underlying such statistical homogeneity, we have analyzed a model of synaptic integration incorporating a highly simplified integrate and fire mechanism with decay. We analyzed a ``high-input regime'' in which neurons receive hundreds of excitatory synaptic inputs during each interspike interval. To produce a graded response in this regime, the neuron must balance excitation with inhibition. We find that a simple integrate and fire mechanism with balanced excitation and inhibition produces a highly variable interspike interval, consistent with experimental data. Detailed information about the temporal pattern of synaptic inputs cannot be recovered from the pattern of output spikes, and we infer that cortical neurons are unlikely to transmit information in the temporal pattern of spike discharge. Rather, we suggest that quantities are represented as rate codes in ensembles of 50-100 neurons. These column-like ensembles tolerate large fractions of common synaptic input and yet covary only weakly in their spike discharge. We find that an ensemble of 100 neurons provides a reliable estimate of rate in just one interspike interval (10-50 msec). Finally, we derived an expression for the variance of the neural spike count that leads to a stable propagation of signal and noise in networks of neurons-that is, conditions that do not impose an accumulation or diminution of noise. The solution implies that single neurons perform simple algebra resembling averaging, and that more sophisticated computations arise by virtue of the anatomical convergence of novel combinations of inputs to the cortical column from external sources.",

These results suggested that MT neurons might provide the signals supporting behavioral choice in visual discrimination tasks. To approach this question from another direction, we have now studied the relationship between the discharge of MT neurons and behavioral choice, independently of the effects of visual stimulation. We found that trial-to-trial variability in neuronal signals was correlated with the choices the monkey made. Therefore, when a directionally selective neuron in area MT fires more vigorously, the monkey is more likely to make a decision in favor of the preferred direction of the cell. The magnitude of the relationship was modest, on average, but was highly significant across a sample of 299 cells from four monkeys. The relationship was present for all stimuli (including those without a net motion signal), and for all but the weakest responses. The relationship was reduced or eliminated when the demands of the task were changed so that the directional signal carried by the cell was less informative. The relationship was evident within 50 ms of response onset, and persisted throughout the stimulus presentation. On average, neurons that were more sensitive to weak motion signals had a stronger relationship to behavior than those that were less sensitive. These observations are consistent with the idea that neuronal signals in MT are used by the monkey to determine the direction of stimulus motion. The modest relationship between behavioral choice and the discharge of any one neuron, and the prevalence of the relationship across the population, make it likely that signals from many neurons are pooled to form the data on which behavioral choices are based.",

Although the neural signals underlying sensory processing have been studied extensively, little is known about how the brain accrues and holds these sensory signals to guide later actions. Previous work has suggested that neural activity in the lateral intraparietal area (LIP) of the monkey brain reflects the formation of perceptual decisions in a random dot direction-discrimination task in which monkeys communicate their decisions with eye-movement responses. We tested the hypothesis that decision-related neural activity in LIP represents the time integral of the momentary motion ``evidence.'' By briefly perturbing the strength of the visual motion stimulus during the formation of perceptual decisions, we tested whether this LIP activity reflected a persistent, integrated ``memory'' of these brief sensory events. We found that the responses of LIP neurons reflected substantial temporal integration. Brief pulses had persistent effects on both the monkeys' choices and the responses of neurons in LIP, lasting up to 800 ms after appearance. These results demonstrate that LIP is involved in neural time integration underlying the accumulation of evidence in this task. Additional analyses suggest that decision-related LIP responses, as well as behavioral choices and reaction times, can be explained by near-perfect time integration that stops when a criterion amount of evidence has been accumulated. Temporal integration may be a fundamental computation underlying higher cognitive functions that are dissociated from immediate sensory inputs or motor outputs.",

They fall into two major groups which differ in the role they impute to space in hippocampal information processing. On the one hand, the cognitive map theory sees space as crucial and central, with other types of non-spatial information embedded in a primary spatial framework. On the other hand, most other theories see the function of the hippocampal formation as broader, treating all types of information as equivalent and concentrating on the processes carried out irrespective of the specific material being represented, stored and manipulated. One crucial difference therefore is the extent to which theories see hippocampal pyramidal cells as representing non-spatial information independently of a spatial framework. Studies have reported the existence of single hippocampal unit responses to non-spatial stimuli, both to simple sensory inputs as well as to more complex stimuli such as objects, conspecifics, rewards and time, and these findings been interpreted as evidence in favor of a broader hippocampal function. Alternatively, these non-spatial responses might actually be feature-in-place signals where the spatial nature of the response has been masked by the fact that the objects or features were only presented in one location or one spatial context. In this paper, we argue that when tested in multiple locations, the hippocampal response to non-spatial stimuli is almost invariably dependent on the animal's location. Looked at collectively, the data provide strong support for the cognitive map theory.",

Our understanding of the processes underlying learning and memory has been dominated by the view that synapses are the principal site of information storage in the brain. This view has received substantial support from research in several model systems, with the vast majority of studies on the topic corroborating a role for synapses in memory storage. Yet, despite the neuroscience community's best efforts, we are still without conclusive proof that memories reside at synapses. Furthermore, an increasing number of non-synaptic mechanisms have emerged that are also capable of acting as memory substrates.

This finding suggests that attention has co-opted the circuits that mediate contrast gain control and that it operates by increasing the effective contrast of the attended stimulus. Consistent with this idea, microstimulation of the frontal eye fields, one of several areas that control the allocation of spatial attention, induces spatially local increases in sensitivity both at the behavioral level and among neurons in area V4, where endogenously generated attention increases contrast sensitivity.

We addressed this question by combining a task, in which choice options had to be retrieved from memory, with cognitive modeling and fMRI. We found that memory-guided decisions are captured by established process models of choice (sequential sampling models) but constrained by forgetting. People are biased toward remembered options and reject them only if they are very unattractive. Using a Bayesian modeling approach, we determined the posterior probability that options were remembered given the observed choices. This probability correlated with hippocampal activation during encoding. During decision making, the bias toward remembered options was linked to increased connectivity between hippocampus and ventromedial prefrontal cortex. Our results provide insights into the dependency of decisions on memory constraints and show that memory-related activation can be inferred from decisions.",

Here we studied multicell spiking patterns in both the visual cortex and hippocampus during slow-wave sleep in rats. We found that spiking patterns not only in the cortex but also in the hippocampus were organized into frames, defined as periods of stepwise increase in neuronal population activity. The multicell firing sequences evoked by awake experience were replayed during these frames in both regions. Furthermore, replay events in the sensory cortex and hippocampus were coordinated to reflect the same experience.

  abstract = "The hippocampus is involved in numerous cognitive functions, some of which have uniquely human aspects, such as autobiographical memory. Hippocampal anatomy, however, is typically considered conserved across primates and its evolutionary diversification is rarely studied. Comparing hippocampal structure and function is, therefore, critical for understanding human brain architecture. Here, we developed a novel comparative framework to study the hippocampus across species characterising its geometry, microstructure, and functional network embedding. In humans and macaques, we generated a new comparative space that represents the hippocampus as an unfolded surface, which respects its sheet-like anatomy. We mapped histological and MRI-derived markers of microstructure to the hippocampal surface and integrated it with low-dimensional embedding of resting-state MRI connectivity data. Our results demonstrate that the micro– and macro-structural organisation of the hippocampus are overall conserved in both species, showing consistent anterior-posterior and subfield-to-subfield differentiation. Furthermore, while hippocampal functional organisation also follows anterior-posterior trends in both species, hippocampal functional connectivity markedly reflected evolutionary reconfiguration of transmodal networks, in particular the default-mode network. Specifically, the inferior parietal lobe in the macaque mirrors an incomplete integration of the default mode network in non-human primates. By combining fine-grained anatomical investigation with large-scale functional imaging, we showed that microstructurally preserved regions like the hippocampus may still undergo functional reconfiguration, due to their embedding in higher-order association networks. Summary While the hippocampus is key for uniquely human cognitive abilities, it is also a phylogenetically old cortex and paradoxically considered evolutionarily preserved. Here, we introduce a comparative framework to quantify preservation and reconfiguration of hippocampal organisation in primate evolution, by analysing the hippocampus as an unfolded cortical surface that is geometrically matched across species. Our findings revealed an overall conservation of hippocampal macro– and micro-structure, showing anterior-posterior and, perpendicularly, subfield-related organisational axes in both humans and macaques. However, while functional organisation in both species also followed an anterior-posterior axis, the latter showed a marked evolutionary reconfiguration, which mirrors a rudimentary integration of the default-mode-network in non-human primates. Our findings suggest that microstructurally preserved regions like the hippocampus may still undergo functional reconfiguration in primate evolution, due to their embedding in heteromodal association networks. \#\#\# Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest.",

There were brief bursts of narrow-band gamma oscillations (45-100 Hz), varied in time and frequency, accompanying encoding and re-activation of sensory information. They appeared at a minority of recording sites associated with spiking reflecting the to-be-remembered items. Beta oscillations (20-35 Hz) also occurred in brief, variable bursts but reflected a default state interrupted by encoding and decoding. Only activity of neurons reflecting encoding/decoding correlated with changes in gamma burst rate. Thus, gamma bursts could gate access to, and prevent sensory interference with, working memory. This supports the hypothesis that working memory is manifested by discrete oscillatory dynamics and spiking, not sustained activity.",

When rats come to a decision point, they sometimes pause and look back and forth as if deliberating over the choice; at other times, they proceed as if they have already made their decision. In the 1930s, this pause-and-look behaviour was termed 'vicarious trial and error' (VTE), with the implication that the rat was 'thinking about the future'. The discovery in 2007 that the firing of hippocampal place cells gives rise to alternating representations of each of the potential path options in a serial manner during VTE suggested a possible neural mechanism that could underlie the representations of future outcomes. More-recent experiments examining VTE in rats suggest that there are direct parallels to human processes of deliberative decision making, working memory and mental time travel.",

Here we describe an approach to solving dimensionality reduction problems that uses easily measured local metric information to learn the underlying global geometry of a data set. Unlike classical techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA) and multidimensional scaling (MDS), our approach is capable of discovering the nonlinear degrees of freedom that underlie complex natural observations, such as human handwriting or images of a face under different viewing conditions. In contrast to previous algorithms for nonlinear dimensionality reduction, ours efficiently computes a globally optimal solution, and, for an important class of data manifolds, is guaranteed to converge asymptotically to the true structure.",

In these experiments, neurophysiologists have attempted to explain variability in movement time with variability in neuronal activity. However, in natural settings, movements are not usually triggered by abrupt sensory cues. What underlies the timing of action under such circumstances, when movements are uncoupled or only weakly coupled to abrupt events in the external world? We trained monkeys to perform the same arm movement either in direct reaction to a salient visual event, or as a self-timed action, less coupled to any obvious external trigger. Neurons in cortical area 5 exhibited phasic discharge modulations that were generally comparable for both modes of action, with some neurons increasing and others decreasing their firing rates with movement. For self-timed movements, however, there was an additional, slow ramp-up or ramp-down of activity in the few hundred milliseconds before the phasic discharge. These ramping modulations occurred well before any detectable changes in arm-muscle activity and their time course bore a striking resemblance to activity in the putamen preceding self-timed movements, observed previously. Together, the results suggest a possible mechanism for the internal timing of action within the motor system. In this model, reverberant activity in corticobasal-ganglia circuits reaches a threshold level resulting in much larger perimovement discharges within the same network, consequently driving the initiation of action.",

While measuring an interval, neural responses had a nonlinear profile that increased with the duration of the sample interval. Activity was reset during the transition from measurement to production and was followed by a ramping activity whose slope encoded the previously measured sample interval. We found that firing rates at the end of the measurement epoch were correlated with both the slope of the ramp and the monkey's corresponding production interval on a trial-by-trial basis. Analysis of response dynamics further linked the rate of change of firing rates in the measurement epoch to the slope of the ramp in the production epoch. These observations suggest that, during time reproduction, an interval is measured prospectively in relation to the desired motor plan to reproduce that interval.",

Eye movements are not made for reward, and they are rarely restricted.

Such experiments have demonstrated that activity in the lateral intraparietal (LIP) area of the monkey correlates with the monkey's planning of a memory-guided saccade or deciding where, on the basis of motion information, to make a saccade. However, other experiments have shown that neural activity in LIP can easily be dissociated from the generation of saccadic eye movements, especially when sophisticated behavioral paradigms dissociate the monkey's locus of attention from the goal of an intended saccade. In this study, we trained monkeys to report the results of a visual search task by making a nontargeting hand movement. Once the task began, the monkeys were entirely free to move their eyes, and rewards were not contingent on the monkeys making specific eye movements. We found that neural activity in LIP predicted not only the goal of the monkey's saccades but also their saccadic latencies.",

The model captures several key features of the response of decision-making neurons as well as the increase in reaction time as a function of the number of alternatives, known as Hick's law. In addition, we show that in the presence of divisive normalization and internal variability, our model can account for several so-called 'irrational' behaviors, such as the similarity effect as well as the violation of both the independence of irrelevant alternatives principle and the regularity principle.",

We have recorded from monkey posterior parietal cortex while the animal viewed a visual stimulus that disappeared, and then, depending on experimental context, could be inferred to be either moving or stationary. During this temporary absence of the stimulus, about half of the neurons were found to be significantly more active on those trials in which the stimulus could be presumed to be moving rather than stationary.

To overcome these challenges, we describe a general-purpose time warping framework that reveals precise spike-time patterns in an unsupervised manner, even when spiking is decoupled from behavior or is temporally stretched across single trials. We demonstrate this method across diverse systems: cued reaching in nonhuman primates, motor sequence production in rats, and olfaction in mice. This approach flexibly uncovers diverse dynamical firing patterns, including pulsatile responses to behavioral events, LFP-aligned oscillatory spiking, and even unanticipated patterns, like 7 Hz oscillations in rat motor cortex that are not time-locked to measured behaviors or LFP.",

Recent work describing neuronal parallels between spatial and non-spatial behaviors has rekindled the notion of a systematic organization of knowledge across multiple domains. We review experimental evidence and theoretical frameworks that point to principles unifying these apparently disparate functions. These principles describe how to learn and use abstract, generalizable knowledge and suggest that map-like representations observed in a spatial context may be an instance of general coding mechanisms capable of organizing knowledge of all kinds. We highlight how artificial agents endowed with such principles exhibit flexible behavior and learn map-like representations observed in the brain. Finally, we speculate on how these principles may offer insight into the extreme generalizations, abstractions, and inferences that characterize human cognition.",

  abstract = "During spatial navigation, neural activity in the hippocampus and the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) is correlated to navigational variables such as location, head direction, speed, and proximity to boundaries. These activity patterns are thought to provide a map-like representation of physical space. However, the hippocampal-entorhinal circuit is involved not only in spatial navigation, but also in a variety of memory-guided behaviours. The relationship between this general function and the specialized spatial activity patterns is unclear. A conceptual framework reconciling these views is that spatial representation is just one example of a more general mechanism for encoding continuous, task-relevant variables. Here we tested this idea by recording from hippocampal and entorhinal neurons during a task that required rats to use a joystick to manipulate sound along a continuous frequency axis. We found neural representation of the entire behavioural task, including activity that formed discrete firing fields at particular sound frequencies. Neurons involved in this representation overlapped with the known spatial cell types in the circuit, such as place cells and grid cells. These results suggest that common circuit mechanisms in the hippocampal-entorhinal system are used to represent diverse behavioural tasks, possibly supporting cognitive processes beyond spatial navigation.",

Here we analysed the dimensionality of the encoding of natural images by large populations of neurons in the visual cortex of awake mice. The evoked population activity was high-dimensional, and correlations obeyed an unexpected power law: the nth principal component variance scaled as 1/n. This scaling was not inherited from the power law spectrum of natural images, because it persisted after stimulus whitening. We proved mathematically that if the variance spectrum was to decay more slowly then the population code could not be smooth, allowing small changes in input to dominate population activity. The theory also predicts larger power-law exponents for lower-dimensional stimulus ensembles, which we validated experimentally. These results suggest that coding smoothness may represent a fundamental constraint that determines correlations in neural population codes.",

This allows animals to purposively create new affordances that they can later exploit to achieve high-level goals, resulting in intentional action that links across multiple levels of control.

Here, we used an hM4Di synaptic-silencing approach to test our hypothesis that specific mPFC→RE and mPFC→PER projections regulate sequence memory retrieval. First, we found non-overlapping populations of mPFC cells project to RE and PER. Second, suppressing mPFC activity impaired sequence memory. Third, inhibiting mPFC→RE and mPFC→PER pathways effectively abolished sequence memory. Finally, a sequential lag analysis showed that the mPFC→RE pathway contributes to a working memory retrieval strategy, whereas the mPFC→PER pathway supports a temporal context memory retrieval strategy.

Here we examined spatial representations in the EC of head-fixed monkeys performing a free-viewing visual memory task. Individual neurons were identified in the primate EC that emitted action potentials when the monkey fixated multiple discrete locations in the visual field in each of many sequentially presented complex images. These firing fields possessed spatial periodicity similar to a triangular tiling with a corresponding well-defined hexagonal structure in the spatial autocorrelation. Further, these neurons showed theta-band oscillatory activity and changing spatial scale as a function of distance from the rhinal sulcus, which is consistent with previous findings in rodents. These spatial representations may provide a framework to anchor the encoding of stimulus content in a complex visual scene. Together, our results provide a direct demonstration of grid cells in the primate and suggest that EC neurons encode space during visual exploration, even without locomotion.",

A primary neuroscience goal is to uncover neuron-level mechanistic models that quantitatively explain this behavior by predicting primate performance for each and every image. Here, we applied this stringent behavioral prediction test to the leading mechanistic models of primate vision (specifically, deep, convolutional, artificial neural networks; ANNs) by directly comparing their behavioral signatures against those of humans and rhesus macaque monkeys. Using high-throughput data collection systems for human and monkey psychophysics, we collected more than one million behavioral trials from 1472 anonymous humans and five male macaque monkeys for 2400 images over 276 binary object discrimination tasks. Consistent with previous work, we observed that state-of-the-art deep, feedforward convolutional ANNs trained for visual categorization (termed DCNNIC models) accurately predicted primate patterns of object-level confusion. However, when we examined behavioral performance for individual images within each object discrimination task, we found that all tested DCNNIC models were significantly nonpredictive of primate performance and that this prediction failure was not accounted for by simple image attributes nor rescued by simple model modifications. These results show that current DCNNIC models cannot account for the image-level behavioral patterns of primates and that new ANN models are needed to more precisely capture the neural mechanisms underlying primate object vision. To this end, large-scale, high-resolution primate behavioral benchmarks such as those obtained here could serve as direct guides for discovering such models.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Recently, specific feedforward deep convolutional artificial neural networks (ANNs) models have dramatically advanced our quantitative understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying primate core object recognition. In this work, we tested the limits of those ANNs by systematically comparing the behavioral responses of these models with the behavioral responses of humans and monkeys at the resolution of individual images. Using these high-resolution metrics, we found that all tested ANN models significantly diverged from primate behavior. Going forward, these high-resolution, large-scale primate behavioral benchmarks could serve as direct guides for discovering better ANN models of the primate visual system.",

We find that the observed complexity and functional roles of single neurons are readily understood in the framework of a dynamical process unfolding at the level of the population. The population dynamics can be reproduced by a trained recurrent neural network, which suggests a previously unknown mechanism for selection and integration of task-relevant inputs.

Thus, the monkeys' natural tendency was to categorize images by their ordinal number. Additional, secondary strategies were used eventually to avoid the distractor images.

These results led to the question of whether any of these neurons could serve the memory of complex objects. We report here a group of shape-selective neurons in an anterior ventral part of the temporal cortex of monkeys that exhibited sustained activity during the delay period of a visual short-term memory task.

  abstract = "The human brain has often been viewed as outstanding among mammalian brains: the most cognitively able, the largest-than-expected from body size, endowed with an overdeveloped cerebral cortex that represents over 80\% of brain mass, and purportedly containing 100 billion neurons and 10x more glial cells. Such uniqueness was seemingly necessary to justify the superior cognitive abilities of humans over larger-brained mammals such as elephants and whales. However, our recent studies using a novel method to determine the cellular composition of the brain of humans and other primates as well as of rodents and insectivores show that, since different cellular scaling rules apply to the brains within these orders, brain size can no longer be considered a proxy for the number of neurons in the brain. These studies also showed that the human brain is not exceptional in its cellular composition, as it was found to contain as many neuronal and non-neuronal cells as would be expected of a primate brain of its size. Additionally, the so-called overdeveloped human cerebral cortex holds only 19\% of all brain neurons, a fraction that is similar to that found in other mammals. In what regards absolute numbers of neurons, however, the human brain does have two advantages compared to other mammalian brains: compared to rodents, and probably to whales and elephants as well, it is built according to the very economical, space-saving scaling rules that apply to other primates; and, among economically built primate brains, it is the largest, hence containing the most neurons. These findings argue in favor of a view of cognitive abilities that is centered on absolute numbers of neurons, rather than on body size or encephalization, and call for a re-examination of several concepts related to the exceptionality of the human brain.",

Synaptic plasticity constitutes a cellular mechanism that is thought to underlie information storage and memory formation in the brain, and represents a use-dependent long-lasting increase or decrease in synaptic strength. Recent findings, that the adult visual cortex undergoes dynamic synaptic plasticity that is driven by active visual experience, suggest that it may be involved in information processing that could contribute to memory formation. The visual cortex provides a crucial sensory input to the hippocampus, and is a key component for the creation of spatial memories. An understanding of how visual cortical neurons respond with synaptic plasticity to visual experience, and whether these responses influence the induction of hippocampal plasticity, is fundamental to our understanding of the neuronal mechanisms and functional consequences of visuospatial information processing. In this review, we summarize recent findings with regard to the expression of dynamic synaptic plasticity in the visual cortex and how this plasticity may influence information processing in the hippocampus.",

Here, we lay out a family of approaches by which model-based computation may be built upon a core of TD learning. The foundation of this framework is the successor representation, a predictive state representation that, when combined with TD learning of value predictions, can produce a subset of the behaviors associated with model-based learning, while requiring less decision-time computation than dynamic programming. Using simulations, we delineate the precise behavioral capabilities enabled by evaluating actions using this approach, and compare them to those demonstrated by biological organisms. We then introduce two new algorithms that build upon the successor representation while progressively mitigating its limitations. Because this framework can account for the full range of observed putatively model-based behaviors while still utilizing a core TD framework, we suggest that it represents a neurally plausible family of mechanisms for model-based evaluation.",

  abstract = "Author(s): Hamrick, Jessica B. | Advisor(s): Griffiths, Thomas L. | Abstract: At any given moment, the mind needs to decide how to think about what, and for how long. The mind's ability to manage itself is one of the hallmarks of human cognition, and these meta-level questions are crucially important to understanding how cognition is so fluid and flexible across so many situations. In this thesis, I investigate the problem of cognitive resource management by focusing in particular on the domain of mental simulation. Mental simulation is a phenomenon in which people can perceive and manipulate objects and scenes in their imagination in order to make decisions, predictions, and inferences about the world. Importantly, if thinking is computation, then mental simulation is one particular type of computation analogous to having a rich, forward model of the world.Given access to such a model as rich and flexible as mental simulation, how should the mind use it? How does the mind infer anything from the outcomes of its simulations? How many resources should be allocated to running which simulations? When should such a rich forward model be used in the first place, in contrast to other types of computation such as heuristics or rules? Understanding the answers to these questions provides broad insight into people's meta-level reasoning because mental simulation is involved in almost every aspect of cognition, including perception, memory, planning, physical reasoning, language, social cognition, problem solving, scientific reasoning, and even creativity. Through a series of behavioral experiments combined with machine learning models, I show how people adaptively use their mental simulations to learn new things about the world; that they choose which simulations to run based on which they think will be more informative; and that they allocate their cognitive resources to spend less time on easy problems and more time on hard problems.",

  abstract = "It is generally accepted that there is something special about reasoning by using mental images. The question of how it is special, however, has never been satisfactorily spelled out, despite more than thirty years of research in the post-behaviorist tradition. This article considers some of the general motivation for the assumption that entertaining mental images involves inspecting a picture-like object. It sets out a distinction between phenomena attributable to the nature of mind to what is called the cognitive architecture, and ones that are attributable to tacit knowledge used to simulate what would happen in a visual situation. With this distinction in mind, the paper then considers in detail the widely held assumption that in some important sense images are spatially displayed or are depictive, and that examining images uses the same mechanisms that are deployed in visual perception. I argue that the assumption of the spatial or depictive nature of images is only explanatory if taken literally, as a claim about how images are physically instantiated in the brain, and that the literal view fails for a number of empirical reasons--for example, because of the cognitive penetrability of the phenomena cited in its favor. Similarly, while it is arguably the case that imagery and vision involve some of the same mechanisms, this tells us very little about the nature of mental imagery and does not support claims about the pictorial nature of mental images. Finally, I consider whether recent neuroscience evidence clarifies the debate over the nature of mental images. I claim that when such questions as whether images are depictive or spatial are formulated more clearly, the evidence does not provide support for the picture-theory over a symbol-structure theory of mental imagery. Even if all the empirical claims were true, they do not warrant the conclusion that many people have drawn from them: that mental images are depictive or are displayed in some (possibly cortical) space. Such a conclusion is incompatible with what is known about how images function in thought. We are then left with the provisional counterintuitive conclusion that the available evidence does not support rejection of what I call the ``null hypothesis''; namely, that reasoning with mental images involves the same form of representation and the same processes as that of reasoning in general, except that the content or subject matter of thoughts experienced as images includes information about how things would look.",

Targeted alteration of the natural temporal contiguity of visual experience caused specific changes in IT position tolerance. This unsupervised temporal slowness learning (UTL) was substantial, increased with experience, and was significant in single IT neurons after just 1 hour.

These results were only evident, however, when imagery conditions were compared to a non-imagery baseline in which the same auditory cues were presented (and hence the stimuli were controlled); when a resting baseline was used (and hence brain activation was uncontrolled), imagery activation was obscured because of activation in visual cortex during the baseline condition. These findings resolve a debate in the literature about whether imagery activates early visual cortex and indicate that visual mental imagery involves 'depictive' representations, not solely language-like descriptions. Moreover, the fact that stored visual information can affect processing in even the earliest visual areas suggests that knowledge can fundamentally bias what one sees.",

In particular, they may be involved in the ``consolidation'' of information in higher-order associational cortices, perhaps through feedback projections. This review highlights the fact that the medial temporal lobe is organized as a hierarchy of associational networks. Indeed, associational connections within the perirhinal, parahippocampal, and entorhinal cortices enables a significant amount of integration of unimodal and polymodal inputs, so that only highly integrated information reaches the remainder of the hippocampal formation. The feedback efferent projections from the perirhinal and parahippocampal cortices to the neocortex largely reciprocate the afferent projections from the neocortex to these areas. There are, however, noticeable differences in the degree of reciprocity of connections between the perirhinal and parahippocampal cortices and certain areas of the neocortex, in particular in the frontal and temporal lobes. These observations are particularly important for models of hippocampal-neocortical interaction and long-term storage of information in the neocortex. Furthermore, recent functional studies suggest that the perirhinal and parahippocampal cortices are more than interfaces for communication between the neocortex and the hippocampal formation.

We therefore continuously tracked awake replay in the same hippocampal-prefrontal ensembles throughout learning of a spatial alternation task. We found that, during pauses between behavioral trajectories, reverse and forward hippocampal replay supports an internal cognitive search of available past and future possibilities and exhibits opposing learning gradients for prediction of past and future behavioral paths, respectively. Coordinated hippocampal-prefrontal replay distinguished correct past and future paths from alternative choices, suggesting a role in recall of past paths to guide planning of future decisions for spatial working memory.

For instance, during delay periods in working memory tasks, while stimuli are represented in working memory, neurons in the prefrontal cortex, thought to support the memory representation, exhibit time-varying neuronal activity. Since neuronal activity encodes the stimulus, its time-varying dynamics appears to be paradoxical and incompatible with stable network stimulus representations. Indeed, this finding raises a fundamental question: can stable representations only be encoded with stable neural activity, or, its corollary, is every change in activity a sign of change in stimulus representation? RESULTS: Here we explain how different time-varying representations offered by individual neurons can be woven together to form a coherent, time-invariant, representation. Motivated by two ubiquitous features of the neocortex-redundancy of neural representation and sparse intracortical connections-we derive a network architecture that resolves the apparent contradiction between representation stability and changing neural activity. Unexpectedly, this network architecture exhibits many structural properties that have been measured in cortical sensory areas. In particular, we can account for few-neuron motifs, synapse weight distribution, and the relations between neuronal functional properties and connection probability. CONCLUSIONS: We show that the intuition regarding network stimulus representation, typically derived from considering single neurons, may be misleading and that time-varying activity of distributed representation in cortical circuits does not necessarily imply that the network explicitly encodes time-varying properties.",

Further, it has been shown that grid cells resemble the eigenvectors of the relationship between place cells and can be learnt from local inputs. Here we show that these locally-learnt eigenvectors contain not only local information but also global knowledge that can provide both distributions over future states as well as a global distance measure encoding approximate distances between every object in the world. By simply changing the weights in the grid cell population, it is possible to switch between computing these different measures. We demonstrate a simple algorithm can use these measures to globally navigate arbitrary topologies without searching more than one step ahead. We refer to this as intuitive planning.",

  abstract = "Interference disrupts information processing across many timescales, from immediate perception to memory over short and long durations. The widely held similarity assumption states that as similarity between interfering information and memory contents increases, so too does the degree of impairment. However, information is lost from memory in different ways. For instance, studied content might be erased in an all-or-nothing manner. Alternatively, information may be retained but the precision might be degraded or blurred. Here, we asked whether the similarity of interfering information to memory contents might differentially impact these 2 aspects of forgetting. Observers studied colored images of real-world objects, each followed by a stream of interfering objects. Across 4 experiments, we manipulated the similarity between the studied object and the interfering objects in circular color space. After interference, memory for object color was tested continuously on a color wheel, which in combination with mixture modeling, allowed for estimation of how erasing and blurring differentially contribute to forgetting. In contrast to the similarity assumption, we show that highly dissimilar interfering items caused the greatest increase in random guess responses, suggesting a greater frequency of memory erasure (Experiments 1-3). Moreover, we found that observers were generally able to resist interference from highly similar items, perhaps through surround suppression (Experiments 1 and 4). Finally, we report that interference from items of intermediate similarity tended to blur or decrease memory precision (Experiments 3 and 4). These results reveal that the nature of visual similarity can differentially alter how information is lost from memory. (PsycINFO Database Record",

Ordered-tree analysis of individual subjects' recall protocols produced hierarchical trees consistent with regularities in output order. Spatial priming and distance estimations depended on whether pairs of objects appeared in the same subtree or in different subtrees.

We reconstruct a map-like knowledge structure directly from a hippocampal-entorhinal functional magnetic resonance imaging adaptation signal in a situation where relationships are non-spatial rather than spatial, discrete rather than continuous, and unavailable to conscious awareness. Notably, the measure that best predicted a behavioural signature of implicit knowledge and blood oxygen level-dependent adaptation was a weighted sum of future states, akin to the successor representation that has been proposed to account for place and grid-cell firing patterns.",

It has been suggested that we might drop representational language altogether and seek to understand the brain, more simply, as a dynamical system. In this review, we argue that the concept of representation provides a useful link between dynamics and computational function and ask which aspects of brain activity should be analyzed to achieve a representational understanding.

Specifically, the detailed analysis of tasks and of the behavior they elicit is best suited for discovering component processes and their underlying algorithms. In most cases, we argue that study of the neural implementation of behavior is best investigated after such behavioral work.

Its key unit is the 'grid cell', which is activated whenever the animal's position coincides with any vertex of a regular grid of equilateral triangles spanning the surface of the environment. Grids of neighbouring cells share a common orientation and spacing, but their vertex locations (their phases) differ. The spacing and size of individual fields increase from dorsal to ventral dMEC.

The resulting range for unambiguous position representation is vastly greater than the approximately 1-10 m periods of individual lattices, allowing for unique high-resolution position specification over the behavioral foraging ranges of rats, with excess capacity that could be used for error correction. Next, we show that the merits of the grid cell code for position representation extend well beyond capacity and include arithmetic properties that facilitate position updating. We conclude by considering the numerous implications, for downstream readouts and experimental tests, of the properties of the grid cell code.",

We show, under these principles, artificial neural networks embedded with hierarchy and fast Hebbian memory, can learn the statistics of memories and generalise structural knowledge. Spatial neuronal representations mirroring those found in the brain emerge, suggesting spatial cognition is an instance of more general organising principles.

However, errors accumulate rapidly when velocity inputs are integrated in existing models of grid cell activity. To produce grid-cell-like responses, these models would require frequent resets triggered by external sensory cues. Such inadequacies, shared by various models, cast doubt on the dead-reckoning potential of the grid cell system. Here we focus on the question of accurate path integration, specifically in continuous attractor models of grid cell activity. We show, in contrast to previous models, that continuous attractor models can generate regular triangular grid responses, based on inputs that encode only the rat's velocity and heading direction. We consider the role of the network boundary in the integration performance of the network and show that both periodic and aperiodic networks are capable of accurate path integration, despite important differences in their attractor manifolds. We quantify the rate at which errors in the velocity integration accumulate as a function of network size and intrinsic noise within the network. With a plausible range of parameters and the inclusion of spike variability, our model networks can accurately integrate velocity inputs over a maximum of approximately 10-100 meters and approximately 1-10 minutes. These findings form a proof-of-concept that continuous attractor dynamics may underlie velocity integration in the dorsolateral medial entorhinal cortex. The simulations also generate pertinent upper bounds on the accuracy of integration that may be achieved by continuous attractor dynamics in the grid cell network. We suggest experiments to test the continuous attractor model and differentiate it from models in which single cells establish their responses independently of each other.",

However, the population code for space did not generalize across tasks, particularly where stimuli relevant to the associative memory task appeared. Single-neuron and population-level analyses revealed that cross-task changes were due to selectivity for nonspatial features of the associative memory task when they were visually available (perceptual coding) and following their disappearance (mnemonic coding).

This task is thought to capture the essence of reasoning -- the appreciation of distant relationships among elements distributed across multiple facts or memories. Surprisingly, we found that current architectures struggle to reason over long distance associations. Similar results were obtained on a more complex task involving finding the shortest path between nodes in a path. We therefore developed MEMO, an architecture endowed with the capacity to reason over longer distances. This was accomplished with the addition of two novel components. First, it introduces a separation between memories (facts) stored in external memory and the items that comprise these facts in external memory. Second, it makes use of an adaptive retrieval mechanism, allowing a variable number of ``memory hops'' before the answer is produced.

  abstract = "Reinforcement learning agents often forget details of the past, especially after delays or distractor tasks. Agents with common memory architectures struggle to recall and integrate across multiple timesteps of a past event, or even to recall the details of a single timestep that is followed by distractor tasks. To address these limitations, we propose a Hierarchical Chunk Attention Memory (HCAM), which helps agents to remember the past in detail. HCAM stores memories by dividing the past into chunks, and recalls by first performing high-level attention over coarse summaries of the chunks, and then performing detailed attention within only the most relevant chunks. An agent with HCAM can therefore ``mentally time-travel'' -- remember past events in detail without attending to all intervening events. We show that agents with HCAM substantially outperform agents with other memory architectures at tasks requiring long-term recall, retention, or reasoning over memory. These include recalling where an object is hidden in a 3D environment, rapidly learning to navigate efficiently in a new neighborhood, and rapidly learning and retaining new object names. Agents with HCAM can extrapolate to task sequences much longer than they were trained on, and can even generalize zero-shot from a meta-learning setting to maintaining knowledge across episodes. HCAM improves agent sample efficiency, generalization, and generality (by solving tasks that previously required specialized architectures). Our work is a step towards agents that can learn, interact, and adapt in complex and temporally-extended environments.",

Humans and other animals can abstract this structural knowledge and generalise it to solve new problems. For example, in spatial reasoning, shortest-path inferences are immediate in new environments. Spatial structural transfer is mediated by grid cells in entorhinal and (in humans) medial prefrontal cortices, which maintain their structure across different environments. Here, using fMRI, we show that entorhinal and mPFC representations perform a much broader role in generalising the structure of problems. We introduce a task-remapping paradigm, where subjects solve multiple reinforcement learning (RL) problems differing in structural or sensory properties. We show that, as with space, entorhinal representations are preserved across different RL problems only if task structure is preserved. In ventromedial PFC, representations of standard RL signals such as prediction error also vary as a function of task structure.",

We tested whether the hippocampus (HC), entorhinal cortex (EC), and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC)/medial orbitofrontal cortex (mOFC) organize abstract and discrete relational information into a cognitive map to guide novel choices. Subjects learned the status of people in two separate unseen 2-D social hierarchies defined by competence and popularity piecemeal from binary comparisons. Although only one dimension was ever behaviorally relevant, multivariate activity patterns in HC, EC and mOFC were linearly related to the Euclidian distance between people in the mentally reconstructed 2-D space. Hubs created unique comparisons between the two hierarchies, enabling inferences between novel pairs of people. We found that both behavior and neural activity in EC and vmPFC/mOFC reflected the Euclidian distance to the retrieved hub, which was reinstated in HC. These findings reveal how abstract and discrete relational structures are represented, combined, and navigated in the human brain.",

We propose learning higher-order graphs -- structured in a specific way that allows efficient learning, hierarchy formation, and inference -- as the general principle that connects these different desiderata. We show that these graphs can be learned efficiently from experienced sequences using a cloned Hidden Markov Model (CHMM), and uncertainty-aware planning can be achieved using message-passing inference. Using diverse experimental settings, we show that CHMMs can be used to explain the emergence of context-specific representations, formation of transferable structural knowledge, transitive inference, shortcut finding in novel spaces, remapping of place cells, and hierarchical planning. Structured higher-order graph learning and probabilistic inference might provide a simple unifying framework for understanding hippocampal function, and a pathway for relational abstractions in artificial intelligence.",

Similar investigation in prefrontal cortex revealed schematic representations of distances and actions, and exposed a previously unknown variable, the 'trajectory-phase'. The internal structure was conserved across mice, allowing using one animal's data to decode another animal's behavior.

Abstraction was defined operationally using the generalization performance of neural decoders across task conditions not used for training. This type of generalization requires a particular geometric format of neural representations. Neural ensembles in dorsolateral pre-frontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex and hippocampus, and in simulated neural networks, simultaneously represented multiple hidden and explicit variables in a format reflecting abstraction.

We show that mixed selectivity neurons encode distributed information about all task-relevant aspects. Each aspect can be decoded from the population of neurons even when single-cell selectivity to that aspect is eliminated. Moreover, mixed selectivity offers a significant computational advantage over specialized responses in terms of the repertoire of input-output functions implementable by readout neurons. This advantage originates from the highly diverse nonlinear selectivity to mixtures of task-relevant variables, a signature of high-dimensional neural representations. Crucially, this dimensionality is predictive of animal behaviour as it collapses in error trials. Our findings recommend a shift of focus for future studies from neurons that have easily interpretable response tuning to the widely observed, but rarely analysed, mixed selectivity neurons.",

We argue that this low-dimensional code supports generalisation of relational information, even in nonspatial domains.

The data suggest that the hippocampus is critical for recollection but not familiarity. The parahippocampal cortex also contributes to recollection, possibly via the representation and retrieval of contextual (especially spatial) information, whereas perirhinal cortex contributes to and is necessary for familiarity-based recognition.

Local cortical dynamics are thought to shape these patterns throughout movement execution2-4. External inputs have been implicated in setting the initial state of the motor cortex5,6, but they may also have a pattern-generating role. Here we dissect the contribution of local dynamics and inputs to cortical pattern generation during a prehension task in mice. Perturbing cortex to an aberrant state prevented movement initiation, but after the perturbation was released, cortex either bypassed the normal initial state and immediately generated the pattern that controls reaching or failed to generate this pattern. The difference in these two outcomes was probably a result of external inputs. We directly investigated the role of inputs by inactivating the thalamus; this perturbed cortical activity and disrupted limb kinematics at any stage of the movement. Activation of thalamocortical axon terminals at different frequencies disrupted cortical activity and arm movement in a graded manner. Simultaneous recordings revealed that both thalamic activity and the current state of cortex predicted changes in cortical activity. Thus, the pattern generator for dexterous arm movement is distributed across multiple, strongly interacting brain regions.",

This book, in turn, derives from the discovery that individual hippocampal neurons act as place cells, with the complete set of place cells tiling an enclosure, forming a type of spatial map. It was found that unique environments had unique place cell representations. That is, if one takes the hippocampal map of a specific environment, this representation scrambles, or ``remaps'' when the animal is placed in a different environment. Several authors have speculated that ``maps'' and ``remapping'' form the physiological substrates for context and context shifting. One difficulty with this definition is that it is exclusively spatial; it can only be inferred when an animal locomotes in an enclosure. There are five aims for this article. The first is to give an historical overview of context as a variable that controls behavior. The second aim is to give an historical overview of concepts of place cell maps and remapping. The third aim is to propose an updated definition of a place cell map, based on temporal rather than spatial overlaps, which adds flexibility. The fourth aim is to address the issue of whether the biological phenomenon of hippocampal remapping, is, in fact, the substrate for shifts in the psychological phenomenon of context. The final aim is speculation of how contextual representations may contribute to effective behavior.",

Here, we examined the representational geometry of value in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), a part of the brain linked to economic decision-making. We found that values were encoded along a curved manifold in vmPFC. This curvilinear geometry predicted a specific pattern of irrational decision-making: that decision-makers will make worse choices when an irrelevant, decoy option is worse in value, compared to when it is better. Indeed, we observed these irrational choices in behavior. Together, these results not only suggest that the representational geometry of value is nonlinear, but that this nonlinearity could impose bounds on rational decision-making. \#\#\# Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest.",

Conceptually, episodic memory is increasingly being viewed as subject to lifelong transformations that are reflected in the neural substrates that mediate it. In keeping with this dynamic perspective, research on episodic memory (and the hippocampus) has infiltrated domains, from perception to language and from empathy to problem solving, that were once considered outside its boundaries.

Using this code, we could precisely decode faces from neural population responses and predict neural firing rates to faces. Furthermore, this code disavows the long-standing assumption that face cells encode specific facial identities, confirmed by engineering faces with drastically different appearance that elicited identical responses in single face cells. Our work suggests that other objects could be encoded by analogous metric coordinate systems. PAPERCLIP.",

  abstract = "Faces are among the most important visual stimuli we perceive, informing us not only about a person's identity, but also about their mood, sex, age and direction of gaze. The ability to extract this information within a fraction of a second of viewing a face is important for normal social interactions and has probably played a critical role in the survival of our primate ancestors. Considerable evidence from behavioural, neuropsychological and neurophysiological investigations supports the hypothesis that humans have specialized cognitive and neural mechanisms dedicated to the perception of faces (the face-specificity hypothesis). Here, we review the literature on a region of the human brain that appears to play a key role in face perception, known as the fusiform face area (FFA). Section 1 outlines the theoretical background for much of this work. The face-specificity hypothesis falls squarely on one side of a longstanding debate in the fields of cognitive science and cognitive neuroscience concerning the extent to which the mind/brain is composed of: (i) special-purpose ('domain-specific') mechanisms, each dedicated to processing a specific kind of information (e.g. faces, according to the face-specificity hypothesis), versus (ii) general-purpose ('domain-general') mechanisms, each capable of operating on any kind of information. Face perception has long served both as one of the prime candidates of a domain-specific process and as a key target for attack by proponents of domain-general theories of brain and mind. Section 2 briefly reviews the prior literature on face perception from behaviour and neurophysiology. This work supports the face-specificity hypothesis and argues against its domain-general alternatives (the individuation hypothesis, the expertise hypothesis and others). Section 3 outlines the more recent evidence on this debate from brain imaging, focusing particularly on the FFA. We review the evidence that the FFA is selectively engaged in face perception, by addressing (and rebutting) five of the most widely discussed alternatives to this hypothesis. In section 4, we consider recent findings that are beginning to provide clues into the computations conducted in the FFA and the nature of the representations the FFA extracts from faces. We argue that the FFA is engaged both in detecting faces and in extracting the necessary perceptual information to recognize them, and that the properties of the FFA mirror previously identified behavioural signatures of face-specific processing (e.g. the face-inversion effect). Section 5 asks how the computations and representations in the FFA differ from those occurring in other nearby regions of cortex that respond strongly to faces and objects. The evidence indicates clear functional dissociations between these regions, demonstrating that the FFA shows not only functional specificity but also area specificity. We end by speculating in section 6 on some of the broader questions raised by current research on the FFA, including the developmental origins of this region and the question of whether faces are unique versus whether similarly specialized mechanisms also exist for other domains of high-level perception and cognition.",

The paper's impact had less to do with the particular findings in the paper itself and more to do with the method that it promoted and the picture of the human mind and brain that it led to. The use of a functional localizer to define a candidate region in each subject individually enabled us not just to make pictures of brain activation, but also to ask principled, hypothesis-driven questions about a thing in nature. This method enabled stronger and more extensive tests of the function of each cortical region than had been possible before in humans and, as a result, has produced a large body of evidence that the human cortex contains numerous regions that are specifically engaged in particular mental processes. The growing inventory of cortical regions with distinctive and often very specific functions can be seen as an initial sketch of the basic components of the human mind. This sketch also serves as a roadmap into the vast and exciting new landscape of questions about the computations, structural connections, time course, development, plasticity, and evolution of each of these regions, as well as the hardest question of all: how do these regions work together to produce human intelligence?",

This face activation was used to define a specific region of interest individually for each subject, within which several new tests of face specificity were run. In each of five subjects tested, the predefined candidate ``face area'' also responded significantly more strongly to passive viewing of (1) intact than scrambled two-tone faces, (2) full front-view face photos than front-view photos of houses, and (in a different set of five subjects) (3) three-quarter-view face photos (with hair concealed) than photos of human hands; it also responded more strongly during (4) a consecutive matching task performed on three-quarter-view faces versus hands. Our technique of running multiple tests applied to the same region defined functionally within individual subjects provides a solution to two common problems in functional imaging: (1) the requirement to correct for multiple statistical comparisons and (2) the inevitable ambiguity in the interpretation of any study in which only two or three conditions are compared.

To perform these last two tasks, it is generally thought that humans, mammals and perhaps some insects possess Euclidean cognitive maps, constructed on the basis of input from the path integration system. In this article, I review the rationale and behavioral evidence for this metric cognitive map hypothesis, and find it unpersuasive: in practice, there is little evidence for truly novel shortcuts in animals, and human performance is highly unreliable and biased by environmental features. I develop the alternative hypothesis that spatial knowledge is better characterized as a labeled graph: a network of paths between places augmented with local metric information. What distinguishes such a cognitive graph from a metric cognitive map is that this local information is not embedded in a global coordinate system, so spatial knowledge is often geometrically inconsistent. Human path integration appears to be better suited to piecewise measurements of path lengths and turn angles than to building a consistent map. In a series of experiments in immersive virtual reality, we tested human navigation in non-Euclidean environments and found that shortcuts manifest large violations of the metric postulates. The results are contrary to the Euclidean map hypothesis and support the cognitive graph hypothesis. Apparently Euclidean behavior, such as taking novel detours and approximate shortcuts, can be explained by the adaptive use of non-Euclidean strategies.",

Second, the functional role of these areas in declarative memory is also conserved across species. Third, an evolutionary approach will be key to understanding exactly how the local circuitry of the hippocampus and parahippocampal region supports declarative memory. To highlight the utility of this approach, a schematic model is described in which separate streams of spatial and nonspatial information converge on the hippocampus. By this view, a fundamental function of the mammalian hippocampus is to combine incoming information about spatial context from the postrhinal (parahippocampal in primates) cortex and medial entorhinal area with incoming information about nonspatial items from the perirhinal cortex and lateral entorhinal area. The underlying neurobiological computations that arise from local circuitry enable item-in-context memory and are proposed to be fundamental to many examples of declarative memory, including episodic memory in humans and spatial memory in experimental animals.",

One idea that has emerged from this work is that the severity of memory impairment might increase as more components of the medial temporal lobe are damaged. We have evaluated this idea directly by examining behavioral data from 30 monkeys (ten normal monkeys and 20 monkeys with bilateral lesions involving structures within the medial temporal lobe) that have completed testing on our standard memory battery during the last 10 years. The main finding was that the severity of memory impairment depended on the locus and extent of damage to the medial temporal lobe. Specifically, damage limited to the hippocampal region produced a mild memory impairment. More severe memory impairment was produced when the damage was increased to include the adjacent entorhinal and parahippocampal cortices (the H+ lesion). Finally, memory impairment was even more severe when the H+ lesion was extended forward to include the anterior entorhinal cortex and the perirhinal cortex (H++ lesion). Taken together, these findings suggest that, whereas damage to the hippocampal region produces measurable memory impairment, a substantial part of the severe memory impairment produced by large medial temporal lobe lesions in humans and monkeys can be attributed to damage to entorhinal, perirhinal, and parahippocampal cortices adjacent to the hippocampal region.",

Prior expectations discriminately reduce the MT neural responses depending on their preferred directions, when the sensory evidence is weak. This response reduction effectively sharpens neural population direction tuning. Simulations with a realistic MT population demonstrate that sharpening the tuning can explain the biases and variabilities in smooth pursuit, suggesting that neural computations in the sensory area alone can underpin the integration of prior knowledge and sensory evidence. State-space analysis further supports this by revealing neural signals of prior expectations in the MT population activity that correlate with behavioral changes.",

  abstract = "According to complementary learning systems theory, integrating new memories into the neocortex of the brain without interfering with what is already known depends on a gradual learning process, interleaving new items with previously learned items. However, empirical studies show that information consistent with prior knowledge can be integrated very quickly. We use artificial neural networks with properties like those we attribute to the neocortex to develop a theoretical understanding of the role of consistency with prior knowledge in putatively neocortex-like learning systems, providing new insights into when integration will be fast or slow and how integration might be made more efficient when the items to be learned are hierarchically structured. The work relies on deep linear networks that capture the qualitative aspects of the learning dynamics of the more complex non-linear networks used in previous work. The time course of learning in these networks can be linked to the hierarchical structure in the training data, captured mathematically as a set of dimensions that correspond to the branches in the hierarchy. In this context, a new item to be learned can be characterized as having aspects that project onto previously known dimensions, and others that require adding a new branch/dimension. The projection onto the known dimensions can be learned rapidly without interleaving, but learning the new dimension requires gradual interleaved learning. When a new item only overlaps with items within one branch of a hierarchy, interleaving can focus on the previously known items within this branch, resulting in faster integration with less interleaving overall. The discussion considers how the brain might exploit these facts to make learning more efficient and highlights predictions about what aspects of new information might be hard or easy to learn.",

  abstract = "It has been argued that the hippocampus supports cognition by virtue of its role in flexibly binding together distinct elements of experience. Such 'relational processing' enables us to (re)construct episodic representations of real or imagined events. The present study examined whether hippocampally mediated relational processing also contributes to the construction of semantic representations. To do so, we asked amnesic individuals with medial temporal lobe (MTL) lesions including the hippocampus to generate hypothetical meanings for novel word compounds (e.g., cactus carpet), a task that requires existing concepts to be flexibly linked. The quality of definitions and number of features generated for the novel compounds were lower in patients with MTL lesions than in control participants. Whereas the subset of patients with lesions extending into lateral temporal cortex had additional difficulty generating meanings for pre-existing compounds (e.g., bus station), patients with lesions limited to the MTL showed no such deficit, indicating that their impairment in the novel compound condition was not due to reduced access to semantic information. These findings suggest that the role of hippocampally mediated relational processing extends beyond the episodic domain to include the generation of novel semantic representations.",

Of particular interest has been the extent to which semantic and episodic memory have a shared dependence on the hippocampus. In contrast to the definitive evidence for the link between hippocampus and episodic memory, the role of the hippocampus in semantic memory has been a topic of considerable debate. This debate stems, in part, from highly variable reports of new semantic memory learning in amnesia ranging from profound impairment to full preservation, and various degrees of deficit and ability in between. More recently, a number of significant advances in experimental methods have occurred, alongside new provocative data on the role of the hippocampus in semantic memory, making this an ideal moment to revisit this debate, to re-evaluate data, methods, and theories, and to synthesize new findings. In line with these advances, this review has two primary goals. First, we provide a historical lens with which to reevaluate and contextualize the literature on semantic memory and the hippocampus. The second goal of this review is to provide a synthesis of new findings on the role of the hippocampus and semantic memory. With the perspective of time and this critical review, we arrive at the interpretation that the hippocampus does indeed make necessary contributions to semantic memory. We argue that semantic memory, like episodic memory, is a highly flexible, (re)constructive, relational and multimodal system, and that there is value in developing methods and materials that fully capture this depth and richness to facilitate comparisons to episodic memory. Such efforts will be critical in addressing questions regarding the cognitive and neural (inter)dependencies among forms of memory, and the role that these forms of memory play in support of cognition more broadly. Such efforts also promise to advance our understanding of how words, concepts, and meaning, as well as episodes and events, are instantiated and maintained in memory and will yield new insights into our two most quintessentially human abilities: memory and language.",

In this study, we demonstrated that recent and remote memories were susceptible to a loss of episodic detail in human participants with focal bilateral damage to CA3. Graph theoretic analyses of 7.0-Tesla resting-state fMRI data revealed that CA3 damage disrupted functional integration across the medial temporal lobe (MTL) subsystem of the default network. The loss of functional integration in MTL subsystem regions was predictive of autobiographical episodic retrieval performance. We conclude that human CA3 is necessary for the retrieval of episodic memories long after their initial acquisition and functional integration of the default network is important for autobiographical episodic memory performance.",

  abstract = "The declarative memory system allows us to accurately recognize a countless number of items and events, particularly those strengthened by repeated exposure. However, increased familiarity due to repetition can also lead to false recognition of related but new items, particularly when mechanisms supporting fine-grain mnemonic discrimination fail. The hippocampus is thought to be particularly important in separating overlapping cortical inputs during encoding so that similar experiences can be differentiated. In the current study of male and female human subjects, we examine how neural pattern similarity between repeated exemplars of a given concept (e.g. apple) influences true and false memory for target or lure images. Consistent with past work, we found that subsequent true recognition was related to pattern similarity between concept exemplars and the entire encoding set (global encoding similarity), particularly in ventral visual stream. In addition, memory for an individual target exemplar (a specific apple) could be predicted solely by the degree of pattern overlap between the other exemplars (different apple pictures) of that concept (concept-specific encoding similarity). Critically, subsequent false memory for lures was mitigated when high concept-specific similarity in cortical areas was accompanied by differentiated hippocampal representations of the corresponding exemplars. Furthermore, both true and false memory entailed the reinstatement of concept-related information at varying levels of specificity. These results link both true and false memory to a measure of concept strength expressed in the overlap of cortical representations, and importantly, illustrate how the hippocampus serves to separate concurrent cortical overlap in the service of detailed memory.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTIn some instances, the same processes that help promote memory for a general idea or concept can also hinder more detailed memory judgments, which may involve differentiating between closely related items. The current study shows that increased overlap in cortical representations for conceptually-related pictures is associated with increased accurate recognition of repeated concept pictures. Whether similar lure items were falsely remembered as old further depended on the hippocampus, where the presence of more distinct representations protected again later false memory. This works suggests that the differentiability of brain patterns during perception is related to the differentiability of items in memory, but that fine-grain discrimination depends on the interaction between cortex and the hippocampus.",

Humans are aware of explicit memories, whereas implicit memories control behavior even though we are not aware of them. Efforts to understand the evolution of memory, and to use nonhuman animals to model human memory, will be facilitated by better understanding the extent to which this critical distinction exists in nonhuman animals. Work with metacognition paradigms in the past 20 years has produced a strong case for the existence of explicit memory in nonhuman primates and possibly other nonhuman animals. Clear dissociations of explicit and implicit memory by metacognition have yet to be demonstrated in nonhumans, although dissociations between memory systems by other behavioral techniques, and by brain manipulations, suggest that the explicit-implicit distinction applies to nonhumans. Neurobehavioral studies of metamemory are beginning to identify neural substrates for memory monitoring in the frontal cortex of monkeys.

We report place cells in marmoset hippocampus during free navigation that exhibit remarkable parallels to analogous neurons in other mammalian species.

This local field potential oscillation occurred in short bouts (approximately .4 s)-rather than continuously-and was neither significantly modulated by locomotion nor consistently coupled to place-cell activity.

Such relations are also important over shorter timescales, during online perception. For example, how do we assess the relative spatial positions of objects, their temporal order, or the relationship between their features? Here, we investigate the role of the hippocampus in online relational processing by manipulating attention to different kinds of relations. While undergoing fMRI, participants viewed two images in rapid succession on each trial and performed one of three relational tasks, judging the images' relative: spatial positions, temporal onsets, or sizes. Additionally, they sometimes judged whether one image was tilted, irrespective of the other. This served as a baseline item task with no demands on relational processing. The hippocampus showed reliable deactivation when participants attended to relational vs. item information. Attention to temporal relations was associated with the most robust deactivation. One interpretation of such deactivation is that it reflects hippocampal disengagement. If true, there should be reduced information content and noisier activity patterns for the temporal vs. other tasks. Instead, multivariate pattern analysis revealed more stable hippocampal representations in the temporal task. This increased pattern similarity was not simply a reflection of lower univariate activity. Thus, the hippocampus differentiates between relational and item processing even during online perception, and its representations of temporal relations are particularly robust. These findings suggest that the relational computations of the hippocampus extend beyond long-term memory, enabling rapid extraction of relational information in perception.",

Some researchers argue that the hippocampus plays a broad role in episodic and declarative memory, whereas others argue for a specific role in the creation of spatial cognitive maps and navigation. Although both views have merit, neither provides a complete account of hippocampal function. Guided by recent reviews that attempt to bridge between these views, here we suggest that reconciliation can be accomplished by exploring hippocampal function from the perspective of Tolman's (1948) original conception of a cognitive map as organizing experience and guiding behavior across all domains of cognition. We emphasize recent studies in animals and humans showing that hippocampal networks support a broad range of domains of cognitive maps, that these networks organize specific experiences within the contextually relevant map, and that network activity patterns reflect behavior guided through cognitive maps. These results are consistent with a framework that bridges theories of hippocampal function by conceptualizing the hippocampus as organizing incoming information within the context of a multidimensional cognitive map of spatial, temporal, and associational context. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Research of hippocampal function is dominated by two major views. The spatial view argues that the hippocampus tracks routes through space, whereas the memory view suggests a broad role in declarative memory. Both views rely on considerable evidence, but neither provides a complete account of hippocampal function. Here we review evidence that, in addition to spatial context, the hippocampus encodes a wide variety of information about temporal and situational context, about the systematic organization of events in abstract space, and about routes through maps of cognition and space. We argue that these findings cross the boundaries of the memory and spatial views and offer new insights into hippocampal function as a system supporting a broad range of cognitive maps.",

To examine the role of the hippocampus in context-dependent recognition directly, the present study tested the effects of large, selective, bilateral hippocampus lesions in rats on performance of a series of spontaneous recognition memory tasks: object recognition, object-place recognition, object-context recognition and object-place-context recognition. Consistent with the effects of fornix lesions, animals with hippocampus lesions were impaired only on the object-place-context task. These data confirm that not all forms of context-dependent associative recognition are mediated by the hippocampus. Subsequent experiments suggested that the object-place task does not require an allocentric representation of space, which could account for the lack of impairment following hippocampus lesions. Importantly, as the object-place-context task has similar spatial requirements, the selective deficit in object-place-context recognition suggests that this task requires hippocampus-dependent neural processes distinct from those required for allocentric spatial memory, or for object memory, object-place memory or object-context memory. Two possibilities are that object, place, and context information converge only in the hippocampus, or that recognition of integrated object-place-context information requires a hippocampus-dependent mode of retrieval, such as recollection.",

A computerized version of this game was written in which human adults or rhesus monkeys were required to find matching pairs of pictures by “flipping over” computer-generated images of cards. Finding one of the 2 to 6 pairs of images (color patches, line drawings, letters, etc.) caused the pictures to remain visible, but errors (mismatches) caused the images to be concealed again and thus required the participants to remember which images had been seen and where each was hidden. In a series of experiments, all participants were able to locate the pairs of stimuli, but monkeys were consistently and significantly worse than the human adults. Indeed, the monkeys frequently perseverated on errors, causing them to be worse than chance in many conditions, even after training. In the present manuscript, data are presented to suggest that this species difference does not simply reflect a limitation on the monkeys’ knowledge of the “rules of the game.”",

Although it has been long suggested that pyramidal cell activity may underlie a topological code rather than a topographic code, it remains unclear whether an abstract spatial topology can be encoded in the ensemble spiking activity of hippocampal place cells. Using a statistical approach developed previously, we investigate this question and related issues in greater detail. We recorded ensembles of hippocampal neurons as rodents freely foraged in one- and two-dimensional spatial environments and used a ``decode-to-uncover'' strategy to examine the temporally structured patterns embedded in the ensemble spiking activity in the absence of observed spatial correlates during periods of rodent navigation or awake immobility. Specifically, the spatial environment was represented by a finite discrete state space. Trajectories across spatial locations (``states'') were associated with consistent hippocampal ensemble spiking patterns, which were characterized by a state transition matrix. From this state transition matrix, we inferred a topology graph that defined the connectivity in the state space. In both one- and two-dimensional environments, the extracted behavior patterns from the rodent hippocampal population codes were compared against randomly shuffled spike data. In contrast to a topographic code, our results support the efficiency of topological coding in the presence of sparse sample size and fuzzy space mapping. This computational approach allows us to quantify the variability of ensemble spiking activity, examine hippocampal population codes during off-line states, and quantify the topological complexity of the environment.",

However, many hippocampal phenomena occur on very short time scales over which long-term average firing rates are not an appropriate description of activity. To understand how rate remapping relates to fine-scale temporal firing phenomena, we asked how rate remapping affected burst firing and trial-to-trial spike count variability. In addition, we looked at how rate remapping relates to the theta-frequency oscillations of the hippocampus, which are thought to temporally organize firing on time scales faster than 100 ms. We found that theta phase coding was preserved through changes in firing rate due to rate remapping. Interestingly, rate remapping in CA1 in response to task demands preferentially occurred during the first half of the theta cycle. The other half of the theta cycle contained preferential expression of phase precession, a phenomenon associated with place cell sequences, in agreement with previous results. This difference of place cell coding during different halves of the theta cycle supports recent theoretical suggestions that different processes occur during the two halves of the theta cycle. The differentiation between the halves of the theta cycle was not clear in recordings from CA3 during rate remapping induced by task-irrelevant sensory changes. These findings provide new insight into the way that temporal coding is utilized in the hippocampus and how rate remapping is expressed through that temporal code.",

The high temporal coordination between place cells exhibited in theta sequences is compatible with the induction of synaptic plasticity and has been proposed as one of the mechanisms underlying the encoding of episodic memory of recently acquired experience. Yet how theta sequences develop with experience has not been directly addressed. Here we simultaneously recorded large numbers of cells in the dorsal hippocampal CA1 area from rats exploring on a novel linear track. Although place cell firing activities accurately represented the animal's current location, distinct theta sequences were absent on the first lap but emerged immediately thereafter and remained stable once established. The absence of theta sequences on the first lap was not due to place field instability, decreased overall excitability of place cells, behavior variables, or the absence of individual neuronal phase precession. We observed strong single-lap phase precession in a significant percentage of place fields on the first lap and throughout the recording. Individual neuronal phase precession was stable from the first lap to subsequent laps but, across neurons, phase precession became more synchronized after experience, suggesting a novel mechanism for the generation of theta sequences. These results suggest that experience-independent temporal coding in individual neurons is combined with rapid plasticity of hippocampal neural networks during experience to acquire predictive representations of the immediate future.",

This suggests that event segmentation during encoding resulted in segmentation of those same events in memory.

The potentiated synaptic input was not initially coincident with action potentials or depolarization. This rule, named behavioral time scale synaptic plasticity, abruptly modifies inputs that were neither causal nor close in time to postsynaptic activation. In slices, five pairings of subthreshold presynaptic activity and calcium (Ca2+) plateau potentials produced a large potentiation with an asymmetric seconds-long time course.

Here, we examined this issue in a case study of LSJ, a patient with complete bilateral hippocampal loss and broader MTL damage. In Experiments 1 and 2, LSJ and matched control participants were passively exposed to a continuous sequence of shapes, syllables, scenes, or tones containing temporal regularities in the co-occurrence of items. In a subsequent test phase, the control groups exhibited reliable SL in all conditions, successfully discriminating regularities from recombinations of the same items into novel foil sequences. LSJ, however, exhibited no SL, failing to discriminate regularities from foils. Experiment 3 ruled out more general explanations for this failure, such as inattention during exposure or difficulty following test instructions, by showing that LSJ could discriminate which individual items had been exposed. These findings provide converging support for the importance of the MTL in extracting temporal regularities.",

In support of spatial processing theories, neurons in the monkey hippocampal formation have striking spatial tuning, and an intact hippocampus is necessary to effectively utilize allocentric spatial relationships. However, the hippocampus also supports non-spatial processes, as its neurons acutely respond to distinct task events and hippocampal damage disrupts both expedient task acquisition and the monitoring of ongoing events in non-spatial paradigms. The features that are shared between spatial and non-spatial hippocampal-dependent tasks point toward a common mechanism underlying hippocampal function that is independent of processing spatial information. We suggest that spatial information is only one facet of immediate experience represented by the hippocampus. The current data support the idea that the hippocampus tracks many aspects of ongoing experience and the primary role of the hippocampus may be in linking experienced events into unitary episodes.",

Spatial representations entail neural activity that is observed when the rat is in a given physical location, and these representations are thought to form the basis of navigation via path integration. Recent studies in nonhuman primates have suggested that similar kinds of spatial representations can be identified, even in the absence of physical movement through an environment. Here, I will highlight some recent work that addresses similarities and differences between spatial responses as identified in rodents and primates.

The ventral, object-processing visual pathway carries precise spatial information, transformed from retinotopic coordinates into relative dimensions. At the final stages of the ventral pathway, including the dorsal anterior temporal lobe (TEd), object-sensitive neurons are intermixed with neurons that process large-scale environmental space. TEd projects primarily to perirhinal cortex (PRC), which in turn projects to lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC). PRC and LEC also combine object and spatial information. For example, PRC and LEC neurons exhibit place fields that are evoked by landmark objects or the remembered locations of objects. Thus, spatial information, on both local and global scales, is deeply integrated into the ventral (temporal) object-processing pathway in vision and memory.",

  abstract = "Primates rely predominantly on vision to gather information from the environment and neurons representing visual space and gaze position are found in many brain areas. Within the medial temporal lobe, a brain region critical for memory, neurons in the entorhinal cortex of macaque monkeys exhibit spatial selectivity for gaze position. Specifically, the firing rate of single neurons reflects fixation location within a visual image (Killian et al., 2012). In the rodents, entorhinal cells such as grid cells, border cells, and head direction cells show spatial representations aligned to visual environmental features instead of the body (Hafting et al., 2005; Sargolini et al., 2006; Solstad et al., 2008; Diehl et al., 2017). However, it is not known whether similar allocentric representations exist in primate entorhinal cortex. Here, we recorded neural activity in the entorhinal cortex in two male rhesus monkeys during a naturalistic, free-viewing task. Our data reveal that a majority of entorhinal neurons represent gaze position and that simultaneously recorded neurons represent gaze position relative to distinct spatial reference frames, with some neurons aligned to the visual image and others aligned to the monkey's head position. Our results also show that entorhinal neural activity can be used to predict gaze position with a high degree of accuracy. These findings demonstrate that visuospatial representation is a fundamental property of entorhinal neurons in primates and suggest that entorhinal cortex may support relational memory and motor planning by coding attentional locus in distinct, behaviorally relevant frames of reference.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The entorhinal cortex, a brain area important for memory, shows striking spatial activity in rodents through grid cells, border cells, head direction cells, and nongrid spatial cells. The majority of entorhinal neurons signal the location of a rodent relative to visual environmental cues, representing the location of the animal relative to space in the world instead of the body. Recently, we found that entorhinal neurons can signal location of gaze while a monkey explores images visually. Here, we report that spatial entorhinal neurons are widespread in the monkey and these neurons are capable of showing a world-based spatial reference frame locked to the bounds of explored images. These results help connect the extensive findings in rodents to the primate.",

The factors important in the pattern completion in CA3 together with a large number of independent memories stored in CA3 include a sparse distributed representation which is enhanced by the graded firing rates of CA3 neurons, representations that are independent due to the randomizing effect of the mossy fibers, heterosynaptic long-term depression as well as long-term potentiation in the recurrent collateral synapses, and diluted connectivity to minimize the number of multiple synapses between any pair of CA3 neurons which otherwise distort the basins of attraction. Recall of information from CA3 is implemented by the entorhinal cortex perforant path synapses to CA3 cells, which in acting as a pattern associator allow some pattern generalization. Pattern separation is performed in the dentate granule cells using competitive learning to convert grid-like entorhinal cortex firing to place-like fields. Pattern separation in CA3, which is important for completion of any one of the stored patterns from a fragment, is provided for by the randomizing effect of the mossy fiber synapses to which neurogenesis may contribute, by the large number of dentate granule cells each with a sparse representation, and by the sparse independent representations in CA3. Recall to the neocortex is achieved by a reverse hierarchical series of pattern association networks implemented by the hippocampo-cortical backprojections, each one of which performs some pattern generalization, to retrieve a complete pattern of cortical firing in higher-order cortical areas.",

Examples include the information that face images provide about the names of the people portrayed, or the information that speech sounds provide about the words spoken. Understanding the signal $x$ requires more than just predicting $y$, it also requires specifying which features of $\X$ play a role in the prediction. We formalize this problem as that of finding a short code for $\X$ that preserves the maximum information about $\Y$. That is, we squeeze the information that $\X$ provides about $\Y$ through a `bottleneck' formed by a limited set of codewords $\tX$. This constrained optimization problem can be seen as a generalization of rate distortion theory in which the distortion measure $d(x,\x)$ emerges from the joint statistics of $\X$ and $\Y$. This approach yields an exact set of self consistent equations for the coding rules $X \to \tX$ and $\tX \to \Y$. Solutions to these equations can be found by a convergent re-estimation method that generalizes the Blahut-Arimoto algorithm.

Microprocessors are among those artificial information processing systems that are both complex and that we understand at all levels, from the overall logical flow, via logical gates, to the dynamics of transistors. We show that the approaches reveal interesting structure in the data but do not meaningfully describe the hierarchy of information processing in the microprocessor. This suggests current analytic approaches in neuroscience may fall short of producing meaningful understanding of neural systems, regardless of the amount of data.

In particular, when monkeys are tested in tasks that do not require navigation, spatial memory seems unaffected by lesions of the hippocampus. However, the interpretation of these results is compromised by long-term compensatory adaptation occurring in the days and weeks after lesions. To test the hypothesis that hippocampus is necessary for nonnavigational spatial memory, we selected a technique that avoids long-term compensatory adaptation. We transiently disrupted hippocampal function acutely at the time of testing by microinfusion of the glutamate receptor antagonist kynurenate. Animals were tested on a self-ordered spatial memory task, the Hamilton Search Task. In the task, animals are presented with an array of eight boxes, each containing a food reinforcer; one box may be opened per trial, with trials separated by a delay. Only the spatial location of the boxes serves as a cue to solve the task. The optimal strategy is to open each box once without returning to previously visited locations. Transient inactivation of hippocampus reduced performance to chance levels in a delay-dependent manner. In contrast, no deficits were seen when boxes were marked with nonspatial cues (color). These results clearly document a role for hippocampus in nonnavigational spatial memory in macaques and demonstrate the efficacy of pharmacological inactivation of this structure in this species. Our data bring the role of the hippocampus in monkeys into alignment with the broader framework of hippocampal function.",

However, evidence that such a response is due to the specific retrieval of a similar, previously encoded item is severely lacking. We used eye movement (EM) monitoring during a partial-cue recognition memory task to index reinstatement of lure images behaviorally via the recapitulation of encoding-related EMs or gaze reinstatement. Participants reinstated encoding-related EMs following degraded retrieval cues and this reinstatement was negatively correlated with accuracy for lure images, suggesting that retrieval of existing representations (i.e., pattern completion) underlies lure false alarms. Our findings provide evidence linking gaze reinstatement and pattern completion and advance a functional role for EMs in memory retrieval.",

  abstract = "Expert opinion remains divided on the issue of whether the hippocampal system functions exclusively in spatial information processing, e.g. in navigation or in understanding spatial relations, or whether it plays a more general role in higher brain function. Previous work on monkeys and rats has tended to support the former view, whereas observations in the clinic point to the latter, including functions as diverse as declarative knowledge, episodic memory, word learning, and understanding relations among objects. One influential theory posits a general role for the hippocampal system in associative learning, with emphasis on associations learned rapidly and recently. The results presented here are consistent with this theory, along with previous clinical and theoretical studies indicating that the hippocampal system is necessary for associative learning even if no component of the association relies on spatial information. In the study reported here, rhesus monkeys learned a series of conditional stimulus-response associations involving complex visual stimuli presented on a video monitor. Each stimulus instructed one of three responses: tapping the stimulus with the hand, steady hand contact with the stimulus for a brief period of time, or steady contact for a longer time. Fornix transection impaired the learning of these associations, even though both the stimuli and the responses were nonspatially differentiated, and this deficit persisted for at least 2 years. This finding indicates that the hippocampal system plays an important role in associative learning regardless of the relevance of spatial information to any aspect of the association. Fornix-transected monkeys were impaired in learning new stimulus-response associations even when the stimuli were highly familiar. Thus, the deficit was one of associating each stimulus with a response, as opposed to problems in distinguishing the stimuli from each other. In contrast to these effects, fornix transection did not impair performance when familiar stimuli instructed a response according to an already-learned association, which shows that the deficit was one of learning new associations rather than one of retention or retrieval of previously learned ones. Taken together, these results show that fornix transection causes a long-lasting impairment in associative learning outside of the spatial domain, in a manner consistent with theories of hippocampal-system function that stress a general role in the rapid acquisition of associative knowledge.",

We assessed the role of the hippocampus in deliberation in two experiments. First, using fMRI in healthy participants, we found that BOLD activity in the hippocampus increased as a function of deliberation time. Second, we found that patients with hippocampal damage exhibited more stochastic choices and longer reaction times than controls, possibly due to their failure to construct value-based or internal evidence during deliberation.

The mathematical model produces predictions about accuracy, mean reaction time, error latency, and reaction time distributions that are in good accord with data from 2 experiments conducted with 6 undergraduates. The theory is applied to 4 item recognition paradigms (Sternberg, prememorized list, study–test, and continuous) and to speed–accuracy paradigms; results are found to provide a basis for comparison of these paradigms.

Reported memory uncertainty is correlated with memory error, showing that people incorporate their trial-to-trial memory quality into rewarded decisions. Moreover, memory uncertainty can be combined with other sources of information; after inducing expectations (prior beliefs) about stimuli probabilities, we found that estimates became shifted toward expected colors, with the shift increasing with reported uncertainty. The data are best fit by models in which people incorporate their trial-to-trial memory uncertainty with potential rewards and prior beliefs. Our results suggest that WM represents uncertainty information, and that this can be combined with prior beliefs.

  abstract = "The fate of scientific hypotheses often relies on the ability of a computational model to explain the data, quantified in modern statistical approaches by the likelihood function. The log-likelihood is the key element for parameter estimation and model evaluation. However, the log-likelihood of complex models in fields such as computational biology and neuroscience is often intractable to compute analytically or numerically. In those cases, researchers can often only estimate the log-likelihood by comparing observed data with synthetic observations generated by model simulations. Standard techniques to approximate the likelihood via simulation either use summary statistics of the data or are at risk of producing severe biases in the estimate. Here, we explore another method, inverse binomial sampling (IBS), which can estimate the log-likelihood of an entire data set efficiently and without bias. For each observation, IBS draws samples from the simulator model until one matches the observation. The log-likelihood estimate is then a function of the number of samples drawn. The variance of this estimator is uniformly bounded, achieves the minimum variance for an unbiased estimator, and we can compute calibrated estimates of the variance. We provide theoretical arguments in favor of IBS and an empirical assessment of the method for maximum-likelihood estimation with simulation-based models. As case studies, we take three model-fitting problems of increasing complexity from computational and cognitive neuroscience. In all problems, IBS generally produces lower error in the estimated parameters and maximum log-likelihood values than alternative sampling methods with the same average number of samples. Our results demonstrate the potential of IBS as a practical, robust, and easy to implement method for log-likelihood evaluation when exact techniques are not available.",

In visual perception tasks, observers generally take their uncertainty about a stimulus into account when doing so helps task performance. Whether the same holds in visual working memory tasks is largely unknown. Ten human and two monkey subjects localized a single change in orientation between a sample display containing three ellipses and a test display containing two ellipses. To manipulate uncertainty, we varied the reliability of orientation information by making each ellipse more or less elongated (two levels); reliability was independent across the stimuli. In both species, a variable-precision encoding model equipped with an ``uncertainty-indifferent'' decision rule, which uses only the noisy memories, fitted the data poorly. In both species, a much better fit was provided by a model in which the observer also takes the levels of reliability-driven uncertainty associated with the memories into account. In particular, a measured change in a low-reliability stimulus was given lower weight than the same change in a high-reliability stimulus. We did not find strong evidence that observers took reliability-independent variations in uncertainty into account. Our results illustrate the importance of studying the decision stage in comparison tasks and provide further evidence for evolutionary continuity of working memory systems between monkeys and humans.",

Indeed, the speed and accuracy of such decisions are explained by the accumulation of evidence to a threshold or bound. However, the same framework seems to apply to decisions that are not obviously informed by sequences of evidence samples. Here, we proffer the hypothesis that the sequential character of such tasks involves retrieval of evidence from memory. We explore this hypothesis by focusing on value-based decisions and argue that mnemonic processes can account for regularities in choice and decision time. We speculate on the neural mechanisms that link sampling of evidence from memory to circuits that represent the accumulated evidence bearing on a choice.

Here, we assess a diverse set of 224 models, curated to enable controlled comparison of different model properties, testing their brain predictivity using large-scale functional magnetic resonance imaging data. We find that models with qualitatively different architectures (e.g. CNNs versus Transformers) and markedly different task objectives (e.g. purely visual contrastive learning versus vision-language alignment) achieve near equivalent degrees of brain predictivity, when other factors are held constant. Instead, variation across model visual training diets yields the largest, most consistent effect on emergent brain predictivity. Overarching model properties commonly suspected to increase brain predictivity (e.g. greater effective dimensionality; learnable parameter count) were not robust indicators across this more extensive survey. We highlight that standard model-to-brain linear re-weighting methods may be too flexible, as most performant models have very similar brain-predictivity scores, despite significant variation in their underlying representations. Broadly, our findings point to the importance of visual diet, challenge common assumptions about the methods used to link models to brains, and more concretely outline future directions for leveraging the full diversity of existing open-source models as tools to probe the common computational principles underlying biological and artificial visual systems.",

In a memory task, objects can be differentiated by their to-be-memorized feature (content) as well as accompanying discriminative features (context). We test whether congruent context features, in addition to content similarity, support serial dependence. In four experiments, we observe a stronger serial dependence between objects that share the same context features across trials. Apparently, the binding of content and context features is not erased but rather carried over to the subsequent memory episode. As this reflects temporal dependencies in natural settings, our findings reveal a mechanism that integrates corresponding content and context features to support stable representations of individualized objects over time.",

These 'event-specific rate remapping' (ESR) cells remain lap-specific even when the maze length is unpredictably altered within trials, which suggests that ESR cells treat lap events as fundamental units. The activity pattern of ESR cells is reused to represent lap events when the maze geometry is altered from square to circle, which suggests that it helps transfer knowledge between experiences.

However, these behavioral and brain datasets do not test hypotheses regarding what features are contributing to good predictions and we show that the predictions may be mediated by DNNs that share little overlap with biological vision. More problematically, we show that DNNs account for almost no results from psychological research. This contradicts the common claim that DNNs are good, let alone the best, models of human object recognition. We argue that theorists interested in developing biologically plausible models of human vision need to direct their attention to explaining psychological findings. More generally, theorists need to build models that explain the results of experiments that manipulate independent variables designed to test hypotheses rather than compete on making the best predictions.

Although the psychometric function is well established as a tool for analyzing the relationship between accuracy and stimulus strength, the corresponding chronometric function for the relationship between response time and stimulus strength has not received as much consideration. In this article, we describe a theory of perceptual decision making based on a diffusion model. In it, a decision is based on the additive accumulation of sensory evidence over time to a bound. Combined with simple scaling assumptions, the proportional-rate and power-rate diffusion models predict simple analytic expressions for both the chronometric and psychometric functions. In a series of psychophysical experiments, we show that this theory accounts for response time and accuracy as a function of both stimulus strength and speed-accuracy instructions. In particular, the results demonstrate a close coupling between response time and accuracy. The theory is also shown to subsume the predictions of Piéron's Law, a power function dependence of response time on stimulus strength. The theory's analytic chronometric function allows one to extend theories of accuracy to response time.",

To overcome this overreliance on a schema, we should aim to create robust schemas that are on the one hand strong enough to help to remember and predict, but also malleable enough to avoid such undesirable side effects. This raises the question as to whether there are ways to deliberately influence knowledge construction processes, with the goal to reach such optimally balanced schemas. Here, we will discuss how the mnemonic processes in our brains build long-term knowledge and, more specifically, how different phases of memory formation (encoding, consolidation, retrieval, and reconsolidation) contribute to this schema build-up.

The larger excursion suggests that the subjects required more evidence before making a choice.

For instance, perception is fundamentally limited by the information that the brain can extract from the noisy dynamics of sensory neurons.

Recent theoretical work proposes that how a neural ensemble's sensory tuning properties relate statistically to its correlated noise patterns is a greater determinant of coding accuracy than is absolute noise strength12-14. However, without simultaneous recordings from thousands of cortical neurons with shared sensory inputs, it is unknown whether correlated noise limits coding fidelity. Here we present a 16-beam, two-photon microscope to monitor activity across the mouse primary visual cortex, along with analyses to quantify the information conveyed by large neural ensembles. We found that, in the visual cortex, correlated noise constrained signalling for ensembles with 800-1,300 neurons. Several noise components of the ensemble dynamics grew proportionally to the ensemble size and the encoded visual signals, revealing the predicted information-limiting correlations12-14. Notably, visual signals were perpendicular to the largest noise mode, which therefore did not limit coding fidelity. The information-limiting noise modes were approximately ten times smaller and concordant with mouse visual acuity15. Therefore, cortical design principles appear to enhance coding accuracy by restricting around 90\% of noise fluctuations to modes that do not limit signalling fidelity, whereas much weaker correlated noise modes inherently bound sensory discrimination.",

In these settings, it is generally assumed that subjects commit to a choice at the end of the stimulus stream. Indeed, failure to benefit from the full stream of information is interpreted as a sign of imperfect accumulation or memory leak. Contrary to these assumptions, we show that monkeys performing a direction discrimination task commit to a choice when the accumulated evidence reaches a threshold level (or bound), sometimes long before the end of stimulus. This bounded accumulation of evidence is reflected in the activity of neurons in the lateral intraparietal cortex.

In an attempt to identify fruitful avenues of further research, several heuristic questions about parietal mnemonic activations are considered in light of recent empirical findings: Do such parietal activations reflect memory processes, or their contents? Do they precede, follow, or co-occur with retrieval? What can we learn from their pattern of lateralization? Do they index access to episodic representations, or the feeling of remembering? Are parietal activations graded by memory strength, quantity of retrieved information, or the type of retrieval? How do memory-related activations map onto functional parcellation of parietal lobes suggested by other cognitive phenomena? Consideration of these questions can promote understanding of the relationship between parietal mnemonic effects and perceptual, attentional, and action-oriented cognitive processes.",

These regions respond more for recognized old than correctly rejected new words, suggesting a neural correlate of retrieval success. Despite significant efforts examining retrieval success regions, their role in retrieval remains largely unknown. Here we asked the question, to what degree are the regions performing memory-specific operations? And if so, are they all equally sensitive to successful retrieval, or are other factors such as error detection also implicated? We investigated this question by testing whether activity in retrieval success regions was associated with task-specific contingencies (i.e., perceived targetness) or mnemonic relevance (e.g., retrieval of source context). To do this, we used a source memory task that required discrimination between remembered targets and remembered nontargets. For a given region, the modulation of neural activity by a situational factor such as target status would suggest a more domain-general role; similarly, modulations of activity linked to error detection would suggest a role in monitoring and control rather than the accumulation of evidence from memory per se. We found that parietal retrieval success regions exhibited greater activity for items receiving correct than incorrect source responses, whereas frontal retrieval success regions were most active on error trials, suggesting that posterior regions signal successful retrieval whereas frontal regions monitor retrieval outcome. In addition, perceived targetness failed to modulate fMRI activity in any retrieval success region, suggesting that these regions are retrieval specific. We discuss the different functions that these regions may support and propose an accumulator model that captures the different pattern of responses seen in frontal and parietal retrieval success regions.",

Although previous functional neuroimaging studies have indicated that recency and repetition may modulate similar brain structures, particularly in the region of the inferior parietal cortex, there is extensive behavioral evidence that human subjects can make independent and accurate recognition memory judgments about both an item's recency and its frequency. In the present study, we used fMRI to examine patterns of brain activity during recognition memory for auditory-verbal stimuli that were parametrically and orthogonally manipulated in terms of recency and number of repetitions. We found in a continuous recognition paradigm that the lateral inferior parietal cortex, a region that has previously been associated with recollective forms of memory, is highly sensitive to recency but not repetition. In a multivariate analysis of whole-brain activation patterns, we found orthogonal components that dissociated recency and repetition variables, indicating largely independent neural bases underlying these two factors. The results demonstrate that although both recency and repetition dramatically improve recognition memory performance, the neural bases for this improvement are dissociable, and thus are difficult to explain in terms of access to a unitary memory trace.",

For memory to be established in a long-lasting neocortical store, many learning repetitions are considered necessary after initial encoding into hippocampal circuits. To elucidate the dynamics of hippocampal and neocortical contributions to the early phases of memory formation, we closely followed changes in human functional brain activity while volunteers navigated through two different, initially unknown virtual environments. In one condition, they were able to encode new information continuously about the spatial layout of the maze. In the control condition, no information could be learned because the layout changed constantly. Our results show that the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) encodes memories for spatial locations rapidly, beginning already with the first visit to a location and steadily increasing activity with each additional encounter. Hippocampal activity and connectivity between the PPC and hippocampus, on the other hand, are strongest during initial encoding, and both decline with additional encounters. Importantly, stronger PPC activity related to higher memory-based performance. Compared with the nonlearnable control condition, PPC activity in the learned environment remained elevated after a 24-h interval, indicating a stable change. Our findings reflect the rapid creation of a memory representation in the PPC, which belongs to a recently proposed parietal memory network. The emerging parietal representation is specific for individual episodes of experience, predicts behavior, and remains stable over offline periods, and must therefore hold a mnemonic function.",

Normalization was developed to explain responses in the primary visual cortex and is now thought to operate throughout the visual system, and in many other sensory modalities and brain regions. Normalization may underlie operations such as the representation of odours, the modulatory effects of visual attention, the encoding of value and the integration of multisensory information. Its presence in such a diversity of neural systems in multiple species, from invertebrates to mammals, suggests that it serves as a canonical neural computation.",

We have discovered a unique population code for the experience-dependent value of the context. The degree of reward-driven navigation preference highly correlates with the spatial distribution of the place fields recorded in the CA1 region of the hippocampus. We show place field clustering towards rewarded locations. Optogenetic manipulation of the ventral tegmental area demonstrates that the experience-dependent place field assembly distribution is directed by tegmental dopaminergic activity. The ability of the place cells to remap parallels the acquisition of reward context. Our findings present key evidence that the hippocampal neurons are not merely mapping the static environment but also store the concurrent context reward value, enabling episodic memory for past experience to support future adaptive behavior.",

Here, we study a class of recurrent network models in which the connectivity is a sum of a random part and a minimal, low-dimensional structure. We show that, in such networks, the dynamics are low dimensional and can be directly inferred from connectivity using a geometrical approach. We exploit this understanding to determine minimal connectivity required to implement specific computations and find that the dynamical range and computational capacity quickly increase with the dimensionality of the connectivity structure.

Memory decline in the early stages of AD is mostly limited to episodic memory, for which the hippocampus has a crucial role. However, it has been uncertain whether the observed amnesia in the early stages of AD is due to disrupted encoding and consolidation of episodic information, or an impairment in the retrieval of stored memory information. Here we show that in transgenic mouse models of early AD, direct optogenetic activation of hippocampal memory engram cells results in memory retrieval despite the fact that these mice are amnesic in long-term memory tests when natural recall cues are used, revealing a retrieval, rather than a storage impairment. Before amyloid plaque deposition, the amnesia in these mice is age-dependent, which correlates with a progressive reduction in spine density of hippocampal dentate gyrus engram cells. We show that optogenetic induction of long-term potentiation at perforant path synapses of dentate gyrus engram cells restores both spine density and long-term memory. We also demonstrate that an ablation of dentate gyrus engram cells containing restored spine density prevents the rescue of long-term memory. Thus, selective rescue of spine density in engram cells may lead to an effective strategy for treating memory loss in the early stages of AD.",

Memories are remembered as long as they influence our thoughts, feelings, and behavior at the present time. Memory is also one of the fundamental components of learning, our ability to acquire any type of knowledge or skills. In the brain it is not easy to identify the physical substrate of memory. Basically, any long-lasting alteration of a biochemical process can be considered a form of memory, although some of these alterations last only a few milliseconds, and most of them, if taken individually, cannot influence our behavior. However, if we want to understand memory, we need to keep in mind that memory is not a unitary phenomenon, and it certainly involves several distinct mechanisms that operate at different spatial and temporal levels. One of the goals of theoretical neuroscience is to try to understand how these processes are orchestrated to store memories rapidly and preserve them over a lifetime. Theorists have mostly focused on synaptic plasticity, as it is one of the most studied memory mechanisms in experimental neuroscience and it is known to be highly effective in training artificial neural networks to perform real world tasks. Some of the synaptic plasticity models are purely phenomenological, some others have been designed to solve computational problems. In this article I will review some of these models and I will try to identify computational principles that underlie memory storage and preservation.",

We show that forgetting involves losses in memory accessibility with no changes in memory precision. When participants learned a set of related word–location associations that conformed to a general pattern, we saw a strong trade-off; accessibility was enhanced, whereas precision was reduced. However, this trade-off did not appear to be modulated by time or confer a long-term increase in the total amount of information maintained in memory.

In contrast to this view, recent advances in understanding the neurobiology of long-term memory maintenance lead us to propose that a brain-wide well-regulated decay process, occurring mostly during sleep, systematically removes selected memories. Down-regulation of this decay process can increase the life expectancy of a memory and may eventually prevent its loss. Memory interference usually occurs during certain active processing phases, such as encoding and retrieval, and will be stronger in brain areas with minimal sensory integration and less pattern separation. In areas with efficient pattern separation, such as the hippocampus, interference-driven forgetting will be minimal, and, consequently, decay will cause most forgetting.",

We propose that it is the interaction between persistence and transience that allows for intelligent decision-making in dynamic, noisy environments. Specifically, we argue that transience (1) enhances flexibility, by reducing the influence of outdated information on memory-guided decision-making, and (2) prevents overfitting to specific past events, thereby promoting generalization. According to this view, the goal of memory is not the transmission of information through time, per se. Rather, the goal of memory is to optimize decision-making. As such, transience is as important as persistence in mnemonic systems.",

Dimensionality reduction shows that the four strongest components of neural activity are functionally interpretable, reflecting a state transition between deliberation and commitment, the transformation of sensory evidence into a choice, and the baseline and slope of the rising urgency to decide. Analysis of the contribution of each population to these components shows differences between regions but no distinct clusters within each region. During deliberation, cortical activity unfolds on a two-dimensional “decision manifold” defined by sensory evidence and urgency, and falls off this manifold at the moment of commitment into a choice-dependent trajectory leading to movement initiation. The structure of the manifold varies between regions: In PMd it is curved, in M1 it is nearly perfectly flat, and in dlPFC it is almost entirely confined to the sensory evidence dimension. In contrast, pallidal activity during deliberation is primarily defined by urgency. We suggest that these findings reveal the distinct dynamics of different regions, supporting a unified recurrent attractor model of action selection and execution. \#\#\# Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest.",

This simplicity raises profound and timely conceptual questions. What are its origins and its implications for the complexity of neural dynamics? How would the situation change if we recorded more neurons? When, if at all, can we trust dynamical portraits obtained from measuring an infinitesimal fraction of task relevant neurons? We present a theory that answers these questions, and test it using physiological recordings from reaching monkeys.

This interaction allows memory reactivations, which enhance serial biases in spatial working memory. Stimulus information was not decodable between trials, but remained present in activity-silent traces inferred from spiking synchrony in the PFC. Just before the new stimulus, this latent trace was reignited into activity that recapitulated the previous stimulus representation. Importantly, the reactivation strength correlated with the strength of serial biases in both monkeys and humans, as predicted by a computational model that integrates activity-based and activity-silent mechanisms. Finally, single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation applied to the human PFC between successive trials enhanced serial biases, thus demonstrating the causal role of prefrontal reactivations in determining working-memory behavior.",

A central assumption of neuroscience is that long-term memories are represented by the same brain areas that encode sensory stimuli ( [1][1] ). Neurons in inferotemporal (IT) cortex represent the sensory percept of visual objects using a distributed axis code ( [2][2]–[4][3] ). Whether and how the same IT neural population represents the long-term memory of visual objects remains unclear. Here, we examined how familiar faces are encoded in face patch AM and perirhinal cortex. We found that familiar faces were represented in a distinct subspace from unfamiliar faces. The familiar face subspace was shifted relative to the unfamiliar face subspace at short latency and then distorted to increase neural distances between familiar faces at long latency. This distortion enabled markedly improved discrimination of familiar faces in both AM and PR. Inactivation of PR did not affect these memory traces in AM, suggesting that the memory traces arise from intrinsic recurrent processes within IT cortex or interactions with downstream regions outside the medial temporal lobe ( [5][4], [6][5] ).

Minxha et al. used single-neuron recordings from patients to understand how the human brain retrieves memories on demand when needed for making a decision and how retrieved memories are dynamically routed in the brain from the temporal to the frontal lobe. When memory was not needed, only medial frontal cortex neural activity was correlated with the task. However, when outcome choices required memory retrieval, frontal cortex neurons were phase-locked to field potentials recorded in the medial temporal lobe. Therefore, depending on demands of the task, neurons in different regions can flexibly engage and disengage their activity patterns. Science , this issue p. [eaba3313][1] \#\#\# INTRODUCTION Decision-making in complex environments relies on flexibly combining stimulus representations with context, goals, and memories. A central component of cognitive flexibility is to selectively retrieve information from memory and utilize the retrieved information to make decisions. The medial frontal cortex (MFC) plays a critical role in this process by representing task sets, context, and outcomes. During decision-making, the MFC is thought to selectively engage memory retrieval by representing memory-based choices and mediating interactions between the frontal lobes and the hippocampus and amygdala (HA) through phase-locking of MFC activity to oscillations in the HA. It remains unknown what features of decisions and context are represented in the human MFC and what functional interactions between the MFC and HA mediate dynamic memory retrieval during a task. \#\#\# RATIONALE We recorded single neurons and local field potentials in the human MFC and HA in patients implanted with depth electrodes. Subjects switched between two tasks: recognition memory and categorization. To identify signatures of task demands, we compared the strength of encoding of stimulus familiarity, category, and choices between tasks and tested whether decoders trained in one task generalized to the other task. Such cross-task generalizability would indicate abstract representations of the underlying variables. We hypothesized that this approach would reveal neural signatures of the representations and functional interactions that permit memory-based decisions. \#\#\# RESULTS We recorded from 1430 single neurons in the HA and MFC [dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and the pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA)] across 13 patients. Subjects made “yes” or “no” decisions using button presses or saccades (eye movements) to indicate whether an image was novel or familiar, or whether an image belonged to a given visual category. Instructions were given before each block of trials, explaining the task and response modality to use (i.e., task set). Examining the underlying neural representations at the single-neuron and population levels revealed the following: (i) Cells in the MFC represented task set during baseline periods. These contextual signals emerged rapidly after a task switch and generalized across all response and task-type combinations in the MFC but not the HA. (ii) The strength and geometry of representations of familiarity were task-insensitive in the HA but not in the MFC. The responses of these memory-selective cells were a reflection of memory strength rather than decisions about the memory. (iii) The visual category of stimuli was represented more strongly during the memory task in both the MFC and HA. This encoding of category generalized across tasks fully in the HA but not the MFC. (iv) Choices in both tasks were most strongly represented by cells in the MFC. This choice representation differed in its population-level geometry between the two tasks but was insensitive to response modality (button press or saccade). One subset of MFC cells signaled only memory-based choices, and these cells signaled decisions about the memory. (v) MFC cells phase-locked their activity to theta-frequency band oscillation in the HA preferentially in the memory task, with memory-choice cells also phase-locking in the gamma-frequency band. The strength of this interareal phase-locking in both frequency bands of the MFC cells that signaled memory-based choices was predictive of behavior. \#\#\# CONCLUSION We leveraged the opportunity to record from single neurons in humans to identify representations of choices, task sets, stimulus category, and familiarity in the human MFC and HA. We found that neuronal populations within the MFC formed two separate decision axes: one for memory-based decisions and another for categorization-based decisions. MFC-HA theta-frequency functional connectivity was selectively enhanced during memory retrieval. This work reveals a neuronal mechanism in the human brain whereby oscillation-mediated coordination of activity between distant brain regions and accompanying changes in strength of representation and/or geometry implements task-dependent retrieval of memory. ![Figure][2] Flexible representations of choices in the human frontal lobe. ( A ) Recording locations. LFP, local field potential. ( B ) Population response of all recorded neurons (left) and example of a cell signaling memory-based choices (right). ( C and D ) Representational geometry analysis reveals that different subspaces are used by the two tasks, establishing a memory-specific decision axis. ( E ) Theta- and gamma-band coherence of MFC choice cells with HA LFPs increased during the memory task. Decision-making in complex environments relies on flexibly using prior experience. This process depends on the medial frontal cortex (MFC) and the medial temporal lobe, but it remains unknown how these structures implement selective memory retrieval. We recorded single neurons in the MFC, amygdala, and hippocampus while human subjects switched between making recognition memory–based and categorization-based decisions. The MFC rapidly implemented changing task demands by using different subspaces of neural activity and by representing the currently relevant task goal. Choices requiring memory retrieval selectively engaged phase-locking of MFC neurons to amygdala and hippocampus field potentials, thereby enabling the routing of memories. These findings reveal a mechanism for flexibly and selectively engaging memory retrieval and show that memory-based choices are preferentially represented in the frontal cortex when required.

To test this idea computationally, we investigated recurrent neural network models trained to perform several WM-dependent tasks, in which WM representation emerges from learning and is not a priori assumed to depend on self-sustained persistent activity. We found that short-term synaptic plasticity can support the short-term maintenance of information, provided that the memory delay period is sufficiently short. However, in tasks that require actively manipulating information, persistent activity naturally emerges from learning, and the amount of persistent activity scales with the degree of manipulation required. These results shed insight into the current debate on WM encoding and suggest that persistent activity can vary markedly between short-term memory tasks with different cognitive demands.",

  abstract = "1. An oculomotor delayed-response task was used to examine the spatial memory functions of neurons in primate prefrontal cortex. Monkeys were trained to fixate a central spot during a brief presentation (0.5 s) of a peripheral cue and throughout a subsequent delay period (1-6 s), and then, upon the extinction of the fixation target, to make a saccadic eye movement to where the cue had been presented. Cues were usually presented in one of eight different locations separated by 45 degrees. This task thus requires monkeys to direct their gaze to the location of a remembered visual cue, controls the retinal coordinates of the visual cues, controls the monkey's oculomotor behavior during the delay period, and also allows precise measurement of the timing and direction of the relevant behavioral responses. 2. Recordings were obtained from 288 neurons in the prefrontal cortex within and surrounding the principal sulcus (PS) while monkeys performed this task. An additional 31 neurons in the frontal eye fields (FEF) region within and near the anterior bank of the arcuate sulcus were also studied. 3. Of the 288 PS neurons, 170 exhibited task-related activity during at least one phase of this task and, of these, 87 showed significant excitation or inhibition of activity during the delay period relative to activity during the intertrial interval. 4. Delay period activity was classified as directional for 79\% of these 87 neurons in that significant responses only occurred following cues located over a certain range of visual field directions and were weak or absent for other cue directions. The remaining 21\% were omnidirectional, i.e., showed comparable delay period activity for all visual field locations tested. Directional preferences, or lack thereof, were maintained across different delay intervals (1-6 s). 5. For 50 of the 87 PS neurons, activity during the delay period was significantly elevated above the neuron's spontaneous rate for at least one cue location; for the remaining 37 neurons only inhibitory delay period activity was seen. Nearly all (92\%) neurons with excitatory delay period activity were directional and few (8\%) were omnidirectional. Most (62\%) neurons with purely inhibitory delay period activity were directional, but a substantial minority (38\%) was omnidirectional. 6. Fifteen of the neurons with excitatory directional delay period activity also had significant inhibitory delay period activity for other cue directions. These inhibitory responses were usually strongest for, or centered about, cue directions roughly opposite those optimal for excitatory responses.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

To the extent that ecphory involves 'reawakening' of engrams, leveraging recently developed technologies that can identify and manipulate engrams in rodents provides a fertile avenue for examining retrieval at the level of neuronal ensembles. Here we evaluate emerging neuroscientific research of this type, using cognitive theory as a guiding principle to organize and interpret initial findings. Our Review highlights the critical interaction between engrams and retrieval cues (environmental or artificial) for memory accessibility and retrieval success. These findings also highlight the intimate relationship between the mechanisms important in forming engrams and those important in their recovery, as captured in the cognitive notion of 'encoding specificity'.

Using a modified water-maze paradigm in which platforms are drawn stochastically from a spatial distribution, we found that mice were better at matching platform distributions 30 d compared to 1 d after training. Post-training time-dependent improvements in pattern matching were associated with increased sensitivity to new platforms that conflicted with the pattern. Increased sensitivity to pattern conflict was reduced by pharmacogenetic inhibition of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). These results indicate that pattern identification occurs over time, which can lead to conflicts between new information and existing knowledge that must be resolved, in part, by computations carried out in the mPFC.",

It accomplishes this by assembling consolidated neocortical elements into spatially coherent scenes that form the basis of unfolding memory events.

We imaged mouse InsCtx neurons during two physiological deficiency states: hunger and thirst. InsCtx ongoing activity patterns reliably tracked the gradual return to homeostasis but not changes in behavior. Accordingly, while artificial induction of hunger or thirst in sated mice via activation of specific hypothalamic neurons (AgRP or SFOGLUT) restored cue-evoked food- or water-seeking, InsCtx ongoing activity continued to reflect physiological satiety. During natural hunger or thirst, food or water cues rapidly and transiently shifted InsCtx population activity to the future satiety-related pattern. During artificial hunger or thirst, food or water cues further shifted activity beyond the current satiety-related pattern. Together with circuit-mapping experiments, these findings suggest that InsCtx integrates visceral-sensory signals of current physiological state with hypothalamus-gated amygdala inputs that signal upcoming ingestion of food or water to compute a prediction of future physiological state.",

We demonstrate that the spiking activity of each neuron in the population can be understood as the result of a two-dimensional state space trajectory projected onto the tuning curve of the neuron. The wide variety of observed responses is thus a natural consequence of a population of neurons with a diverse set of preferred stimulus vectors and response functions in this two-dimensional space. In addition, we propose a taxonomy of network topologies that will generate the two-dimensional trajectory necessary to exploit this population.

We show that precise regulation of UNC-104/Kinesin-3 determines the distribution of SV proteins along the axon. The localization of AZ proteins to en passant puncta, however, is largely independent of the major axonal kinesins: UNC-104/Kinesin-3 and UNC-116/Kinesin-1.

In both model systems, these number state spaces were aligned in a way that explicitly facilitated generalisation of relational concepts (more and less).

However, in the derivation of such models as discrete time approximations of the firing rate of a population of neurons, the time constants of the neuronal process are generally ignored. Learning these time constants could inform us about the time scales underlying temporal processes in the brain and enhance the expressive capacity of the network. To investigate the potential of adaptive time constants, we compare the standard approximations to a more lenient one that accounts for the time scales at which processes unfold. We show that such a model performs better on predicting simulated neural data and allows recovery of the time scales at which the underlying processes unfold. A hierarchy of time scales emerges when adapting to data with multiple underlying time scales, underscoring the importance of such a hierarchy in processing complex temporal information.",

Subsequently, we argue that the years from the end of the Second World War until the end of the last century represented the ``golden age'' of system neuroscience. In this period, the mechanisms-not only the localization-underlying sensory, and in particular visual functions were described, followed by those underlying cognitive functions and housed in temporal, parietal, and premotor areas. At the end of the last century, brain imaging techniques were developed that allowed the assessment of the functions of different cortical areas in a more precise and sophisticated way. However, brain imaging tells little about the neural mechanisms underlying functions. Furthermore, the brain imaging suffers from 3 major problems: time is absent, the data are merely correlative and the testing is often not ecological. We conclude our review discussing the possibility that these pitfalls might be overcome by using intracortical recordings (eg stereo-EEG), which have millisecond time resolution, allow direct electrical stimulation of specific sites, and finally enable to study patients while freely moving.",

Toward that end, we start from the general view that the primary role of science is to solve empirical problems, and that it does so by developing theories that can account for phenomena within their domain of application. We propose a commonly-used set of terms - descriptive, mechanistic, and normative - as methodological designations that refer to the kind of problem a theory is intended to solve. Further, we find that models of each kind play distinct roles in defining and bridging the multiple levels of abstraction necessary to account for any neuroscientific phenomenon. We then discuss how models play an important role to connect theory and experiment, and note the importance of well-defined translation functions between them. Furthermore, we describe how models themselves can be used as a form of experiment to test and develop theories. This report is the summary of a discussion initiated at the conference Present and Future Theoretical Frameworks in Neuroscience, which we hope will contribute to a much-needed discussion in the neuroscientific community.",

What proportion of these ongoing fluctuations can be attributed to systematic plasticity processes that maintain memories and neural circuit function? We show under general conditions that the optimal magnitude of systematic plasticity is typically less than the magnitude of perturbations due to internal biological noise. Thus, for any given amount of unavoidable noise, 50\% or more of total synaptic turnover should be effectively random for optimal memory maintenance. Our analysis does not depend on specific neural circuit architectures or plasticity mechanisms and predicts previously unexplained experimental measurements of the activity-dependent component of ongoing plasticity. \#\#\# Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest.",

To understand the computational principles behind these intricate networks of interactions, we construct a broad class of synaptic models that efficiently harness biological complexity to preserve numerous memories by protecting them against the adverse effects of overwriting. The memory capacity scales almost linearly with the number of synapses, which is a substantial improvement over the square root scaling of previous models. This was achieved by combining multiple dynamical processes that initially store memories in fast variables and then progressively transfer them to slower variables. Notably, the interactions between fast and slow variables are bidirectional. The proposed models are robust to parameter perturbations and can explain several properties of biological memory, including delayed expression of synaptic modifications, metaplasticity, and spacing effects.",

We focus on three features that must be addressed by any satisfactory theory of short-term memory. First, we examine the evidence for the architecture of short-term memory, with special attention to questions of capacity and how--or whether--short-term memory can be separated from long-term memory. Second, we ask how the components of that architecture enact processes of encoding, maintenance, and retrieval. Third, we describe the debate over the reason about forgetting from short-term memory, whether interference or decay is the cause. We close with a conceptual model tracing the representation of a single item through a short-term memory task, describing the biological mechanisms that might support psychological processes on a moment-by-moment basis as an item is encoded, maintained over a delay with some forgetting, and ultimately retrieved.",

Is the slower the underlying process, the better? To address this question, we investigated 3 slow biophysical mechanisms that are activity-dependent and prominently present in the prefrontal cortex: Depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition (DSI), calcium-dependent nonspecific cationic current (ICAN), and short-term facilitation. Using a spiking network model for spatial working memory, we found that these processes enhance the memory accuracy by counteracting noise-induced drifts, heterogeneity-induced biases, and distractors. Furthermore, the incorporation of DSI and ICAN enlarges the range of network's parameter values required for working memory function. However, when a progressively slower process dominates the network, it becomes increasingly more difficult to erase a memory trace. We demonstrate this accuracy-flexibility tradeoff quantitatively and interpret it using a state-space analysis. Our results supports the scenario where N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor-dependent recurrent excitation is the workhorse for the maintenance of persistent activity, whereas slow synaptic or cellular processes contribute to the robustness of mnemonic function in a tradeoff that potentially can be adjusted according to behavioral demands.",

We trained rats to perform a confidence-guided waiting task, and derived expressions for optimal waiting that make relevant environmental statistics explicit, including travel time incurred traveling from one reward opportunity to another. We found that rats waited longer than fully optimal agents, but that their behavior was closely matched by optimal agents with travel times constrained to match their own. We developed a process model describing the decision to stop waiting as an accumulation to bound process, which allowed us to compare the effects of multiple sources of internal variability on waiting. Surprisingly, although mean wait times grew with confidence, variability did not, inconsistent with scalar invariant timing, and best explained by variability in the stopping bound. Our results describe a tractable process model that can capture the influence of environmental statistics and internal sources of variability on subjects' decision process during confidence-guided waiting.",

Here we show that pairs of CA1 cells that represent overlapping novel locations are initially more coactive and more precisely coordinated than are cells representing overlapping familiar locations. This increased coordination occurs specifically during brief, high-frequency events (HFEs) in the local field potential that are similar to ripples and is not associated with better coordination of place-specific neural activity outside of HFEs. As novel locations become more familiar, correlations between cell pairs decrease. Thus, hippocampal neural activity during learning has a unique structure that is well suited to induce synaptic plasticity and to allow for rapid storage of new memories.",

However, it remains uncertain whether or not various forms of decision-related activity are causally related to decision making. Here we address this question by recording and reversibly inactivating the lateral intraparietal (LIP) and middle temporal (MT) areas of rhesus macaques performing a motion direction discrimination task. Neurons in area LIP exhibited firing rate patterns that directly resembled the evidence accumulation process posited to govern decision making, with strong correlations between their response fluctuations and the animal's choices. Neurons in area MT, in contrast, exhibited weak correlations between their response fluctuations and choices, and had firing rate patterns consistent with their sensory role in motion encoding. The behavioural impact of pharmacological inactivation of each area was inversely related to their degree of decision-related activity: while inactivation of neurons in MT profoundly impaired psychophysical performance, inactivation in LIP had no measurable impact on decision-making performance, despite having silenced the very clusters that exhibited strong decision-related activity. Although LIP inactivation did not impair psychophysical behaviour, it did influence spatial selection and oculomotor metrics in a free-choice control task. The absence of an effect on perceptual decision making was stable over trials and sessions and was robust to changes in stimulus type and task geometry, arguing against several forms of compensation. Thus, decision-related signals in LIP do not appear to be critical for computing perceptual decisions, and may instead reflect secondary processes. Our findings highlight a dissociation between decision correlation and causation, showing that strong neuron-decision correlations do not necessarily offer direct access to the neural computations underlying decisions.",

We developed a generally applicable tetanus toxin-based method for transgenic mice that permits inducible and reversible inhibition of synaptic transmission and applied it to the trisynaptic pathway while preserving transmission in the monosynaptic pathway. We found that synaptic output from CA3 in the trisynaptic pathway is dispensable and the short monosynaptic pathway is sufficient for incremental spatial learning. In contrast, the full trisynaptic pathway containing CA3 is required for rapid one-trial contextual learning, for pattern completion-based memory recall, and for spatial tuning of CA1 cells.",

We have now examined correlation at longer and shorter time scales and found that pair-wise cross-correlation was predominantly short term (10-100 msec). Narrow, central peaks in the spike train cross-correlograms were largely responsible for correlated spike counts on the time scale of the behavioral epoch. Longer-term (many seconds to minutes) changes in the responsiveness of single neurons were observed in auto-correlations; however, these slow changes in time were on average uncorrelated between neurons. Knowledge of the limited time scale of correlation allowed the derivation of a more efficient metric for spike count correlation based on spike timing information, and it also revealed a potential relative advantage of larger neuronal pools for shorter integration times. Finally, correlation did not depend on the presence of the visual stimulus or the behavioral choice of the animal. It varied little with stimulus condition but was stronger between neurons with similar direction tuning curves. Taken together, our results strengthen the view that common input, common stimulus selectivity, and common noise are tightly linked in functioning cortical circuits.",

The degree of guidance and facilitation of each contextual cue can be related to its inherent informativeness about the target spatial location as measured by human explicit judgments about likely target locations. Our results improve the understanding of the contributions of distinct contextual scene components to search and suggest that the brain's utilization of cues to guide eye movements is linked to the cue's informativeness about the target's location.

Here we propose instead that meaning plays the dominant role in guiding human attention through scenes. To test this proposal, we developed 'meaning maps' that represent the semantic richness of scene regions in a format that can be directly compared to image salience. We then contrasted the degree to which the spatial distributions of meaning and salience predict viewers' overt attention within scenes. The results showed that both meaning and salience predicted the distribution of attention, but that when the relationship between meaning and salience was controlled, only meaning accounted for unique variance in attention. This pattern of results was apparent from the very earliest time-point in scene viewing. We conclude that meaning is the driving force guiding attention through real-world scenes.",

The model comprises 2 parallel pathways; one pathway computes local features (saliency) and the other computes global (scene-centered) features.

Previous studies utilized stimuli of restricted size, a fixed head position, and context defined by the global spatial configuration of the scene. Thus, it is unknown whether similar effects generalize to natural viewing environments and to context defined by local object co-occurrence. Here, with a mobile eye tracker, we investigated the effects of object co-occurrence on search performance under naturalistic conditions. Observers searched for low-visibility target objects on tables cluttered with everyday objects. Targets were either located adjacent to larger, more visible ``cue'' objects that they regularly co-occurred in natural scenes (expected condition) or elsewhere in the display, surrounded by unrelated objects (unexpected condition). Mean search times were shorter for targets at expected locations as compared to unexpected locations. Additionally, context guided eye movements, as more fixations were directed toward cue objects than other non-target objects, particularly when the cue was contextually relevant to the current search target. These results could not be accounted for by image saliency models. Thus, we conclude that object co-occurrence can serve as a contextual cue to facilitate search and guide eye movements in natural environments.",

While this model still has great utility and has led to groundbreaking strategies to treat motor disorders, our evolving knowledge of basal ganglia function has made it clear that this classic model has several shortcomings that severely limit its predictive and descriptive abilities. In this review, we will focus on the striatum, the main input nucleus of the basal ganglia.

In particular, 'double dipping', the use of the same dataset for selection and selective analysis, will give distorted descriptive statistics and invalid statistical inference whenever the results statistics are not inherently independent of the selection criteria under the null hypothesis. To demonstrate the problem, we apply widely used analyses to noise data known to not contain the experimental effects in question.

We develop a computational theory of memory modification, according to which modification of a memory trace occurs through classical associative learning, but which memory trace is eligible for modification depends on a structure learning mechanism that discovers the units of association by segmenting the stream of experience into statistically distinct clusters (latent causes). New memories are formed when the structure learning mechanism infers that a new latent cause underlies current sensory observations. By the same token, old memories are modified when old and new sensory observations are inferred to have been generated by the same latent cause. We derive this framework from probabilistic principles, and present a computational implementation.

For decades, cognitive functions-behavioral control, declarative memory-have served as labels for characterizing the division of labor in cortex. This approach has made enormous contributions to understanding how the brain enables the mind, providing a systems-level explanation of brain function that constrains lower-level investigations of neural mechanism. Today, the approach has evolved such that functional labels are often applied to brain networks rather than focal brain regions. Furthermore, the labels have diversified to include both broadly-defined cognitive functions (declarative memory, visual perception) and more circumscribed mental processes (recollection, familiarity, priming). We ask whether a process-a high-level mental phenomenon corresponding to an introspectively-identifiable cognitive event-is the most productive label for dissecting memory. For example, recollection conflates a neurocomputational operation (pattern completion-based retrieval) with a class of representational content (associative, high-dimensional memories). Because a full theory of memory must identify operations and representations separately, and specify how they interact, we argue that processes like recollection constitute inadequate labels for characterizing neural mechanisms. Instead, we advocate considering the component operations and representations of processes like recollection in isolation.

Choices are better grounded, however, if information is acquired and accumulated over time. In primate visual motion perception, sensory evidence is accumulated up to a limit, at which point the brain commits to a choice. Recalling the models evoked for primate visual perception, recent studies in the rat vibrissal sensorimotor system, using a number of behavioral paradigms, show that perceptual decision making is characterized by the integration of sensory evidence over time. In this integrative process, vibrissal primary somatosensory cortex (vS1 and vS2) act not as the integrator, but as the distributor of sensory information to downstream regions.",

Does this model extend to rodents, and does it account for behavior in which the motor system generates evidence through interactions with the environment? In this study, rats palpated surfaces to identify the texture before them, showing marked trial-to-trial variability in the number of touches prior to expressing their choice. By high-speed video, we tracked whisker kinematic features and characterized how they encoded the contacted texture. Next, we quantified the evidence for each candidate texture transmitted on each touch by the specified whisker kinematic features. The instant of choice was well fit by modeling the brain as an integrator that gives the greatest weight to vibrissal evidence on first touch and exponentially less weight to evidence on successive touches; according to this model, the rat makes a decision when the accumulated quantity of evidence for one texture reaches a boundary. In summary, evidence appears to be accumulated within the brain until sufficient to support a well-grounded choice. These findings extend the framework of bounded sensory integration from primates to rodents and from passively received evidence to evidence that is actively generated by the sensorimotor system.",

Without reconfiguration of the recurrent circuit, the same system can flexibly encode multiple variables of different dimensions while maximizing the coding range (per dimension) by automatically trading-off dimension with an exponentially large coding range. It achieves high efficiency and flexibility by combining two powerful concepts, modularity and mixed selectivity, in what we call ``mixed modular coding''. In contrast to previously proposed schemes, the model does not require the formation of higher-dimensional grid responses, a cell-inefficient and rigid mechanism. The firing fields observed in flying bats or climbing rats can be generated by neurons that combine activity from multiple grid modules, each representing higher-dimensional spaces according to our model. The idea expands our understanding of grid cells, suggesting that they could implement a general circuit that generates on-demand coding and memory states for variables in high-dimensional vector spaces.",

We review recent theoretical and empirical studies that suggest updates and additions to the classic model.

While various tasks can be implemented by increasing the dimensionality in networks consisting of a single global population, flexible input-output mappings instead required networks to be organized into several sub-populations. Our analyses revealed that the subpopulation structure enabled flexible computations through a mechanism based on gain-controlled modulations that flexibly shape the dynamical landscape of collective dynamics.

Here, we propose general methods for reverse engineering recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to identify and elucidate contextual processing. We apply these methods to understand RNNs trained on sentiment classification.

Using the insights learned from the RNNs we improve baseline Bag-of-Words models with simple extensions that incorporate contextual modification, recovering greater than 90\% of the RNN's performance increase over the baseline.

This enables the network to function as a multi-item working memory by cyclic reactivation of up to six items. The reactivation happens at theta frequency, consistently with recent experimental findings, with increasing theta power for each additional item loaded in the network's memory. Furthermore, each memory reactivation is associated with gamma oscillations. Thus, single-cell spike trains as well as gamma oscillations in local groups are nested in the theta cycle. The network also exhibits an idling rhythm in the alpha/beta band associated with a noncoding global attractor.

Moreover, consolidation is known to be selective; that is, some experiences are more likely to be consolidated into long-term memory than others. Here, we propose and analyze a model that captures common computational principles underlying such phenomena. The key component of this model is a mechanism by which a long-term learning and memory system prioritizes the storage of synaptic changes that are consistent with prior updates to the short-term system. This mechanism, which we refer to as recall-gated consolidation, has the effect of shielding long-term memory from spurious synaptic changes, enabling it to focus on reliable signals in the environment. We describe neural circuit implementations of this model for different types of learning problems, including supervised learning, reinforcement learning, and autoassociative memory storage. These implementations involve learning rules modulated by factors such as prediction accuracy, decision confidence, or familiarity. We then develop an analytical theory of the learning and memory performance of the model, in comparison to alternatives relying only on synapse-local consolidation mechanisms. We find that recall-gated consolidation provides significant advantages, substantially amplifying the signal-to-noise ratio with which memories can be stored in noisy environments.

The projections from CA3 to CA1 (Schaffer collaterals), which terminate in the strata radiatum, pyramidale, and oriens, are present throughout the entire transverse extent of CA1. Projections extend both rostrally and caudally from the injection site for as much as three‐fourths of the longitudinal extent of the hippocampus. The associational projections from CA3 to CA3 also travel extensively along the longitudinal axis. CA3 gives rise to more substantial projections to CA1 than to CA3. CA3 projections that originate at the level of the uncus tend to be more restricted to the rostral portions of CA1 and CA3. As in the rodent brain, projections from CA3 to CA1 are distributed along a radial gradient, depending on the transverse location of the cells of origin. CA3 cells located near the dentate gyrus generate projections that more densely terminate superficially in the terminal zone of CA1, whereas CA3 cells located closer to CA1 give rise to projections that more heavily terminate deeply in the terminal zone of CA1. The present results indicate that in the monkey, as in the rat, CA3 cells give rise to extensive projections to CA1 and CA3. Interestingly, radial, transverse, and longitudinal gradients of CA3 fiber distribution, so clear in the rat, are much more subtle in the nonhuman primate brain. J. Comp.

This network, known as the neural integrator, is calibrated during infancy and then maintained through development and trauma with remarkable precision. We have modeled this system with a self-organizing neural network that learns to integrate vestibular velocity commands to generate appropriate eye movements. It learns by using current eye movement on any given trial to calculate the amount of retinal image slip and this is used as the error signal. The synaptic weights are then changed using a straight-forward algorithm that is independent of the network configuration and does not necessitate backwards propagation of information. Minimization of the error in this fashion causes the network to develop multiple positive feedback loops that enable it to integrate a push-pull signal without integrating the background rate on which it rides. The network is also capable of recovering from various lesions and of generating more complicated signals to simulate induced post-saccadic drift and compensation for eye muscle mechanics.",

Here, we use two-photon calcium imaging and electrophysiology in head-fixed walking flies to identify a different neural population that conjunctively encodes heading and angular velocity, and is excited selectively by turns in either the clockwise or counterclockwise direction. We show how these mirror-symmetric turn responses combine with the neurons' connectivity to the compass neurons to create an elegant mechanism for updating the fly's heading representation when the animal turns in darkness. This mechanism, which employs recurrent loops with an angular shift, bears a resemblance to those proposed in theoretical models for rodent head direction cells. Our results provide a striking example of structure matching function for a broadly relevant computation.",

Here, we present a flexible model of working memory that maintains representations through random recurrent connections between two layers of neurons: a structured ``sensory'' layer and a randomly connected, unstructured layer. As the interactions are untuned with respect to the content being stored, the network maintains any arbitrary input. However, in our model, this flexibility comes at a cost: the random connections overlap, leading to interference between representations and limiting the memory capacity of the network. Additionally, our model captures several other key behavioral and neurophysiological characteristics of working memory.",

Evidence suggests that a unitary hippocampal code underlies both episodic memory and predictive processing, yet within a predictive coding framework the hippocampal-neocortical interactions that accompany these two phenomena are distinct and opposing. Namely, during episodic recall, the hippocampus is thought to exert an excitatory influence on the neocortex, to reinstate activity patterns across cortical circuits. This contrasts with empirical and theoretical work on predictive processing, where descending predictions suppress prediction errors to 'explain away' ascending inputs via cortical inhibition. In this hypothesis piece, we attempt to dissolve this previously overlooked dialectic. We consider how the hippocampus may facilitate both prediction and memory, respectively, by inhibiting neocortical prediction errors or increasing their gain. We propose that these distinct processing modes depend upon the neuromodulatory gain (or precision) ascribed to prediction error units. Within this framework, memory recall is cast as arising from fictive prediction errors that furnish training signals to optimise generative models of the world, in the absence of sensory data.",

One of the defining, and largely studied, characteristics of VWM is how resource-limited it is, raising questions about how this resource is shared or split across memoranda. Since objects are rarely equally important in the real world, we ask how people split this resource in settings where objects have different levels of importance. In a psychophysical experiment, participants remembered the location of four targets with different probabilities of being tested after a delay. We then measured their memory accuracy of one of the targets. We found that participants allocated more resource to memoranda with higher priority, but underallocated resource to high- and overallocated to low-priority targets relative to the true probability of being tested. These results are well explained by a computational model in which resource is allocated to minimize expected estimation error. We replicated this finding in a second experiment in which participants bet on their memory fidelity after making the location estimate. The results of this experiment show that people have access to and utilize the quality of their memory when making decisions. Furthermore, people again allocate resource in a way that minimizes memory errors, even in a context in which an alternative strategy was incentivized. Our study not only shows that people are allocating resource according to behavioral relevance, but suggests that they are doing so with the aim of maximizing memory accuracy.",

The posterior parietal cortex, particularly the lateral intraparietal (LIP) area has been suggested to transform visual feature encoding into abstract categorical representations. By contrast, areas closer to sensory input, such as the middle temporal (MT) area, encode stimulus features but not more abstract categorical information during categorization tasks. Here, we compare the contributions of the medial superior temporal (MST) and LIP areas in category computation by recording neuronal activity in both areas from two male rhesus macaques trained to perform a visual motion categorization task. MST is a core motion-processing region interconnected with MT and is often considered an intermediate processing stage between MT and LIP. We show that MST exhibits robust decision-correlated motion category encoding and working memory encoding similar to LIP, suggesting that MST plays a substantial role in cognitive computation, extending beyond its widely recognized role in visual motion processing.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Categorization requires assigning incoming sensory stimuli into behaviorally relevant groups. Previous work found that parietal area LIP shows a strong encoding of the learned category membership of visual motion stimuli, while visual area MT shows strong direction tuning but not category tuning during a motion direction categorization task. Here we show that the medial superior temporal (MST) area, a visual motion-processing region interconnected with both LIP and MT, shows strong visual category encoding similar to that observed in LIP.

  abstract = "Neural activity in the lateral intraparietal cortex (LIP) correlates with both sensory evaluation and motor planning underlying visuomotor decisions. We previously showed that LIP plays a causal role in visually-based perceptual and categorical decisions, and preferentially contributes to evaluating sensory stimuli over motor planning. In that study, however, monkeys reported their decisions with a saccade to a colored target associated with the correct motion category or direction. Since LIP is known to play a role in saccade planning, it remains unclear whether LIP's causal role in such decisions extend to decision-making tasks which do not involve saccades. Here, we employed reversible pharmacological inactivation of LIP neural activity while two male monkeys performed delayed match to category (DMC) and delayed match to sample (DMS) tasks. In both tasks, monkeys needed to maintain gaze fixation throughout the trial and report whether a test stimulus was a categorical match or nonmatch to the previous sample stimulus by releasing a touch bar. LIP inactivation impaired monkeys' behavioral performance in both tasks, with deficits in both accuracy and reaction time (RT). Furthermore, we recorded LIP neural activity in the DMC task targeting the same cortical locations as in the inactivation experiments. We found significant neural encoding of the sample category, which was correlated with monkeys' categorical decisions in the DMC task. Taken together, our results demonstrate that LIP plays a generalized role in visual categorical decisions independent of the task-structure and motor response modality.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Neural activity in the lateral intraparietal cortex (LIP) correlates with perceptual and categorical decisions, in addition to its role in mediating saccadic eye movements. Past work found that LIP is causally involved in visual decisions that are rapidly reported by saccades in a reaction time based decision making task. Here we use reversible inactivation of LIP to test whether LIP is also causally involved in visual decisions when reported by hand movements during delayed matching tasks. Here we show that LIP inactivation impaired monkeys' task performance during both memory-based discrimination and categorization tasks. These results demonstrate that LIP plays a generalized role in visual categorical decisions independent of the task-structure and motor response modality.",

Persistent neural activity maintaining a memory of desired eye position was imaged throughout the oculomotor integrator after saccadic or optokinetic stimulation. While eye position was encoded by the amplitude of network activity, the spatial patterns of firing were context dependent: cells located caudally generally were most persistent following saccadic input, whereas cells located rostrally were most persistent following optokinetic input. To explain these data, we computationally identified four independent modes of network activity and found these were differentially accessed by saccadic and optokinetic inputs. These results show how a circuit can simultaneously encode memory value and behavioral context, respectively, in its amplitude and spatial pattern of persistent firing.",

In a task that alternates exploration and exploitation periods, the ACC monitored negative and positive outcomes relevant for different adaptations. In particular, it produced signals specific of the first reward, i.e., the end of exploration. Those signals disappeared in exploitation periods but immediately transferred to the initiation of trials-a transfer comparable to learning phenomena observed for dopaminergic neurons. Importantly, these were also observed for high gamma oscillations of local field potentials shown to correlate with brain imaging signal.

Indeed, growing evidence suggests that path planning relies on a much more extended neural network, with each of its subcomponent ensuring a specific role in the overall process.

Strikingly, we find that in mice lacking Shank2, an autism spectrum disorder (ASD)-linked gene encoding an excitatory postsynaptic scaffold protein, the learning-induced over-representation of landmarks was absent whereas the over-representation of rewards was substantially increased, as was goal-directed behavior.

  abstract = "Information transfer between brain structures located in the medial-temporal lobe and the neocortex is essential for learning. However, the neuronal underpinnings of this transfer are unknown. Doron et al. found that neurons located in the deep layers of the perirhinal cortex exhibit increased firing after microstimulation upon learning (see the Perspective by Donato). Learning was associated with the emergence of a small population of neurons in layer 5 of the somatosensory cortex that increased bursting upon stimulation. This increase in bursting was accompanied by an increase in dendritic activity, and silencing the perirhinal cortex to layer 1 projection effectively disrupted learning and its physiological correlates. During learning, perirhinal inputs thus act as a gate for the enhancement of cortico-cortical inputs, which are necessary for stimulus detection and are strengthened during learning. Science , this issue p. [eaaz3136][1]; see also p. [1410][2] \#\#\# INTRODUCTION Arguably one of the biggest mysteries in neuroscience is how the brain stores long-term memories. Since the 1950s, it has been well established that long-term memories reside in the neocortex but that their formation is dependent on the hippocampus and medial-temporal lobe structures. It is therefore remarkable that we still do not know what cellular mechanisms underlie long-term memory storage in the neocortex or exactly where they are located. \#\#\# RATIONALE The primary challenge for investigating the neural circuit underlying memory formation in the neocortex is the distributed nature of the resulting memory trace throughout the cortex. We therefore used a behavioral paradigm dependent on both the hippocampus and neocortex that enabled us to generate memory traces in a specific cortical location by training rodents to associate the direct electrical microstimulation of the cortex with a reward. This also allowed us to specifically examine the contribution of circuit elements in the defined anatomical location. Rodents learned to behaviorally report the microstimulation within only a few trials and improved over a 3-day period, during which we examined the evolution of learned neuronal responses in the stimulated area. We hypothesized that the influence of the hippocampus on memory formation in the neocortex occurs at the interface between these two structures. \#\#\# RESULTS We first confirmed that learning to associate microstimulation of the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) with a reward depends on hippocampal activity using suppression of action potentials (APs) with lidocaine in this brain area. Using retrograde and anterograde tracing methods, we found that the perirhinal cortex (the last station in the medial-temporal loop projecting to S1) predominantly targets layer 1 (L1), suggesting that important events relating to memory formation occur in neocortical L1. We tested this with targeted chemogenetic suppression of perirhinal input to L1 above the stimulated S1 region. Notably, this very specific and localized manipulation was sufficient to disrupt learning. The effect was learning-specific and had no influence in expert animals, which demonstrated that the perirhinal input did not alter the ability to perceive and behaviorally report the stimulus, per se. We found that the perirhinal cortex signaled information related to successful behavior during learning, gated the evolution of distinct firing, and enhanced burst responses in 11\% of layer 5 (L5) pyramidal neurons in S1 (40\% of neurons had reduced firing responses and 49\% showed no change in firing). Apical dendritic excitability was correspondingly enhanced in a similar proportion of L5 pyramidal neurons. This suggested that the mechanism for memory formation had a dendritic origin. Consistent with this hypothesis, we found that both activation of γ-aminobutyric acid type B (GABAB) receptors—which disrupt apical dendritic calcium (Ca2+) activity—and activation of dendritic-targeting, somatostatin-positive interneurons impaired memory formation similarly to suppressing perirhinal input to L1. Finally, we found that after learning the microstimulation detection task, evoking a single burst of APs (but not the same number of low-frequency spikes) in a single L5 pyramidal neuron could trigger behavior. \#\#\# CONCLUSION We found that medial-temporal input to neocortical L1 gates the evolution of specific firing responses in subpopulations of L5 pyramidal neurons including up- and down-regulated firing patterns and an elevation in burstiness by means of a mechanism that is most likely related to apical dendritic activity. After learning, these neocortical responses become independent of the medial-temporal influence but continue to evoke behavior with bursts conveying higher saliency. We conclude that L1 is the locus for hippocampal-dependent associative learning in the neocortex, where memory engrams are established in subsets of pyramidal neurons by enhancing the sensitivity of tuft dendrites to contextual inputs and driving burst firing. ![Figure][3] Probing the influence of the medial-temporal lobe on memory formation. ( A ) The perirhinal cortex (PRh), part of the medial-temporal lobe (MTL) structures (blue box), targets L1 in S1. ( B ) We performed microstimulation (μStim) of L5 in the sensory cortex while chemogenetically suppressing the axonal projection to cortical L1 (red) from PRh (blue arrow). ( C ) Rodents learned to associate μStim with water reward. ( D to F ) Learning was suppressed by blocking MTL input [(D) and (E)] that otherwise evoked dendritic activity in L5 pyramidal neurons [(F), orange tuft], which allowed them to associate contextual input to L1 with the μStim. ( G ) More than 3 days of learning led to subpopulations of firing responses in L5 cells in S1 such that evoking a burst but not low-frequency spikes in single L5 cells retrieved learned behavior. Hippocampal output influences memory formation in the neocortex, but this process is poorly understood because the precise anatomical location and the underlying cellular mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we show that perirhinal input, predominantly to sensory cortical layer 1 (L1), controls hippocampal-dependent associative learning in rodents. This process was marked by the emergence of distinct firing responses in defined subpopulations of layer 5 (L5) pyramidal neurons whose tuft dendrites receive perirhinal inputs in L1. Learning correlated with burst firing and the enhancement of dendritic excitability, and it was suppressed by disruption of dendritic activity. Furthermore, bursts, but not regular spike trains, were sufficient to retrieve learned behavior. We conclude that hippocampal information arriving at L5 tuft dendrites in neocortical L1 mediates memory formation in the neocortex.

We address these ambiguities by formalizing remapping in terms of hidden state inference. According to this view, remapping does not directly reflect objective, observable properties of the environment, but rather subjective beliefs about the hidden state of the environment.

Across different virtual environments, most cells remapped randomly, but reward encoding consistently arose from a single pool of cells, suggesting that they formed a dedicated channel for reward.

Perturbation of persistent activity with brief intracellular current pulses designed to mimic saccadic input only induced transient changes of firing rate and membrane potential. When neurons were hyperpolarized below action potential threshold, position-correlated step changes in membrane potential remained.

Cognitive science has developed computational models that decompose cognition into functional components. Computational neuroscience has modeled how interacting neurons can implement elementary components of cognition. It is time to assemble the pieces of the puzzle of brain computation and to better integrate these separate disciplines. Modern technologies enable us to measure and manipulate brain activity in unprecedentedly rich ways in animals and humans. However, experiments will yield theoretical insight only when employed to test brain-computational models. Here we review recent work in the intersection of cognitive science, computational neuroscience and artificial intelligence. Computational models that mimic brain information processing during perceptual, cognitive and control tasks are beginning to be developed and tested with brain and behavioral data.",

Place cells, spatially selective hippocampal neurons that have been extensively studied in rodents, are one component of this map, describing the relative position of environmental features. However, whether this map extends to abstract, cognitive information remains unknown. Using the relative reward value of cues to define continuous ‘paths’ through an abstract value space, we show that single neurons in primate hippocampus encode this space through value place fields, much like a rodent’s place neurons encode paths through physical space. Value place fields remapped when cues changed, but also became increasingly correlated across contexts, allowing maps to become generalized. Our findings help explain the critical contribution of the hippocampus to value-based decision-making, providing a mechanism by which knowledge of relationships in the world can be incorporated into reward predictions for guiding decisions. \#\#\# Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest.",

This hypothesis has been fleshed out in detail for the oculomotor integrator (OI) for which the so-called ``line attractor'' network model can explain a large set of observations. Here we show that there is a plethora of such models, distinguished by the relative strength of recurrent excitation and inhibition. In each model, the firing rates of the neurons relax toward the persistent activity states. The dynamics of relaxation can be quite different, however, and depend on the levels of recurrent excitation and inhibition. To identify the correct model, we directly measure these relaxation dynamics by performing optogenetic perturbations in the OI of zebrafish expressing halorhodopsin or channelrhodopsin. We show that instantaneous, inhibitory stimulations of the OI lead to persistent, centripetal eye position changes ipsilateral to the stimulation. Excitatory stimulations similarly cause centripetal eye position changes, yet only contralateral to the stimulation. These results show that the dynamics of the OI are organized around a central attractor state-the null position of the eyes-which stabilizes the system against random perturbations. Our results pose new constraints on the circuit connectivity of the system and provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying persistent activity.",

  abstract = "An important part of the vestibulo-ocular reflex is a group of cells in the caudal pons, known as the neural integrator, that converts eye-velocity commands, from the semicircular canals for example, to eye-position commands for the motoneurons of the extraocular muscles. Previously, a recurrently connected neural network model was developed by us that learns to simulate the signal processing done by the neural integrator, but it uses an unphysiological learning algorithm. We describe here a new network model that can learn the same task by using a local, Hebbian-like learning algorithm that is physiologically plausible. Through the minimization of a retinal slip error signal the model learns, given randomly selected initial synaptic weights, to both integrate simulated push-pull semicircular canal afferent signals and compensate for orbital mechanics as well. Approximately half of the model's 14 neurons are inhibitory, half excitatory. After learning, inhibitory cells tend to project contralaterally, thus forming an inhibitory commissure. The network can, of course, recover from lesions. The mature network is also able to change its gain by simulating abnormal visual-vestibular interactions. When trained with a sine wave at a single frequency, the network changed its gain at and near the training frequency but not at significantly higher or lower frequencies, in agreement with previous experimental observations. Commissural connections are essential to the functioning of this model, as was the case with our previous model. In order to determine whether a commissure plays a similar role in the real neural integrator, a series of electrical perturbations were performed on the midlines of awake, behaving juvenile rhesus monkeys and the effects on the monkeys' eye movements were examined. Eye movements were recorded using the coil system before, during, and after electrical stimulation in the midline of the pons just caudal to the abducens nuclei, which reversibly made the integrator leaky. Eye movements were also recorded from two of the monkeys before and after a midline electrolytic lesion was made at the location where stimulation produced a leaky integrator. This lesion disabled the integrator irreversibly. The eye movements that were produced by the monkeys as a result of these perturbations were then compared with eye movements produced by the model after analogous perturbations. The results are compatible with the hypothesis that integration comes about by positive feedback through lateral inhibition effected by an inhibitory commissure.",

Answering that question is driving the development of large-scale, single neuron resolution recordings from behaving animals, on the scale of thousands of neurons. But these data are inherently high-dimensional, with as many dimensions as neurons - so how do we make sense of them? For many the answer is to reduce the number of dimensions. Here I argue we can distinguish weak and strong principles of neural dimension reduction. The weak principle is that dimension reduction is a convenient tool for making sense of complex neural data. The strong principle is that dimension reduction shows us how neural circuits actually operate and compute. Elucidating these principles is crucial, for which we subscribe to provides radically different interpretations of the same neural activity data. I show how we could make either the weak or strong principles appear to be true based on innocuous looking decisions about how we use dimension reduction on our data. To counteract these confounds, I outline the experimental evidence for the strong principle that do not come from dimension reduction; but also show there are a number of neural phenomena that the strong principle fails to address. To reconcile these conflicting data, I suggest that the brain has both principles at play.",

However, these insights often seem incompatible, as the debates between symbolic, dynamical, emergentist, sub-symbolic, and grounded approaches to cognition attest. Mental representations—whatever they are—must share many features with each of our theories of representation, and yet there are few hypotheses about how a synthesis could be possible. Here, I develop a theory of the underpinnings of symbolic cognition that shows how sub-symbolic dynamics may give rise to higher-level cognitive representations of structures, systems of knowledge, and algorithmic processes. This theory implements a version of conceptual role semantics by positing an internal universal representation language in which learners may create mental models to capture dynamics they observe in the world. The theory formalizes one account of how truly novel conceptual content may arise, allowing us to explain how even elementary logical and computational operations may be learned from a more primitive basis. I provide an implementation that learns to represent a variety of structures, including logic, number, kinship trees, regular languages, context-free languages, domains of theories like magnetism, dominance hierarchies, list structures, quantification, and computational primitives like repetition, reversal, and recursion. This account is based on simple discrete dynamical processes that could be implemented in a variety of different physical or biological systems. In particular, I describe how the required dynamics can be directly implemented in a connectionist framework. The resulting theory provides an “assembly language” for cognition, where high-level theories of symbolic computation can be implemented in simple dynamics that themselves could be encoded in biologically plausible systems.",

Despite its theoretical and clinical significance, the neural mechanisms of cognitive control are poorly understood. Using a two-frame place avoidance task and partial hippocampal inactivation, we confirmed that intact hippocampal function is necessary for coordinating two streams of spatial information. Rats were placed on a continuously rotating arena and trained to organize their behavior according to two concurrently relevant spatial frames: one stationary, the other rotating. We then studied how information about locations in these two spatial frames is organized in the action potential discharge of ensembles of hippocampal cells. Both streams of information were represented in neuronal discharge-place cell activity was organized according to both spatial frames, but almost all cells preferentially represented locations in one of the two spatial frames. At any given time, most coactive cells tended to represent locations in the same spatial frame, reducing the risk of interference between the two information streams. An ensemble's preference to represent locations in one or the other spatial frame alternated within a session, but at each moment, location in the more behaviorally relevant spatial frame was more likely to be represented. This discharge organized into transient groups of coactive neurons that fired together within 25 ms to represent locations in the same spatial frame. These findings show that dynamic grouping, the transient coactivation of neural subpopulations that represent the same stream of information, can coordinate representations of concurrent information streams and avoid confusion, demonstrating neural-ensemble correlates of cognitive control in hippocampus.",

  abstract = "The firing of place cells in the rodent hippocampus is reliable enough to infer the rodent's position to a high accuracy; however, hippocampal firing also reflects the stages of complex tasks. Theories have suggested that these task-stage responses may reflect changes in reference frame related to task-related subgoals. If the hippocampus represents an environment in multiple ways depending on a task's demands, then switching between these cell assemblies should be detectable as a switch in spatial maps or reference frames. Place cells exhibit extreme temporal variability or ``overdispersion,'' which Fenton et al. suggest reflects changes in active cell-assemblies. If reference-frame switching exists, investigating the relationship of the single cell variability described by Fenton and colleagues to network level processes provides an entry point to understanding the relationship between cell-assembly-like mechanisms and an animal's behavior. We tested the cell-assembly explanation for overdispersion by recording hippocampal neural ensembles from rats running three tasks of varying spatial complexity: linear track (LT), cylinder-foraging (CF), and cylinder-goal (CG). Consistent with the reports by Fenton and colleagues, hippocampal place cells showed high variance in their firing rates across place field passes on the CF and CG tasks. The directional firing of hippocampal place cells on LT provided a test of the reference-frame hypothesis: ignoring direction produced overdispersion similar to the CF and CG tasks; taking direction into account produced a significant decrease in overdispersion. To directly examine the possibility of a network modulation of cell-assemblies, we clustered the firing patterns within each pixel and chained them together to construct whole-environment spatial firing maps. Maps were internally self-consistent, switching with mean rates of several hundred milliseconds. There were significant increases in map-switching rates following reward-related events on the LT and CG tasks, but not on the CF task. Our results link single cell variability with network-level processes and imply that hippocampal spatial representations are made up of multiple, continuous sub-maps, the selection of which depends on the animal's goals when reward is tied to the animal's spatial behavior.",

ACC represents the complete state space of the task, with reward signals that depend strongly on the state where reward is obtained but minimally on the preceding choice. Accordingly, ACC is necessary only for updating model-based strategies, not for basic reward-driven action reinforcement.

We have previously shown that the spiking activity during passes through the firing field is characterized not only by the high firing rate, but also by its very high variability ('overdispersion'). This overdispersion indicates that place cells carry information in addition to position. Here we demonstrate by simulations of an integrate-and-fire neuronal model that while a rat is foraging in an open space this additional information may arise from a process that alternatingly modulates the inputs to place cells by about 10\% with a mean period of about 1 s. We propose that the overdispersion reflects switches of the rats attention between different spatial reference frames of the environment. This predicts that the overdispersion will not be observed in rats that use only room-based cues for navigation. We show that while place cell firing is overdispersed in rats during foraging in an open arena, the firing is less overdispersed during the same behavior in the same environment, when the rats have been trained to use only room-based and not arena-based cues to navigate.",

Place cells characteristically fire too little or too much compared with expectations from the random model. This fundamental property of place cells is referred to as ``excess firing variance'' and has three main implications: (i) Place cell discharge is not only driven by the summation of many small, asynchronous excitatory synaptic inputs.

The neuronal mechanisms of these processes can be investigated by place cell ensemble recordings during behaviors and environmental manipulations that present cognitive control challenges to selectively represent one of multiple possible alternative estimates of location. We review place cell studies that investigate responses to manipulations that dissociate the environment into two or more spatial frames of locations, often times to test notions of pattern separation. Manipulations, such as continuously rotating the recording chamber reveal that the ensemble discharge in hippocampus self-organizes into multiple, transiently-organized representations of space, each defined by the subset of coactive cells. Ensemble discharge in the hippocampus alternates between separate representations of frame-specific positions on timescales from 25 ms to several seconds. The dynamic, functional grouping of discharge into transiently co-active subsets of cells is predicted by the animal's changing behavioral needs. In addition to identifying neural correlates of cognitive control in hippocampus, these observations demonstrate that the separation of neuronal activity into distinctive representations depends on ongoing cognitive demands and that what can appear as noise, deviations from receptive field tuning, can substantially be the result of these internal knowledge-guided fluctuations. These findings inspire a new perspective that should be taken into account when investigating pattern separation--a perspective that emphasizes changes in hippocampal neural discharge that are happening on a short timescale and does not assume that patterns of neural discharge are steady and stationary across the several minutes of the recordings.",

Recently developed algorithms have been successful at training RNNs to perform a wide variety of tasks, but the resulting networks have been treated as black boxes: their mechanism of operation remains unknown. Here we explore the hypothesis that fixed points, both stable and unstable, and the linearized dynamics around them, can reveal crucial aspects of how RNNs implement their computations. Further, we explore the utility of linearization in areas of phase space that are not true fixed points but merely points of very slow movement. We present a simple optimization technique that is applied to trained RNNs to find the fixed and slow points of their dynamics. Linearization around these slow regions can be used to explore, or reverse-engineer, the behavior of the RNN. We describe the technique, illustrate it using simple examples, and finally showcase it on three high-dimensional RNN examples: a 3-bit flip-flop device, an input-dependent sine wave generator, and a two-point moving average. In all cases, the mechanisms of trained networks could be inferred from the sets of fixed and slow points and the linearized dynamics around them.",

Adopting these principles, we introduce the Tolman-Eichenbaum machine (TEM). After learning, TEM entorhinal cells display diverse properties resembling apparently bespoke spatial responses, such as grid, band, border, and object-vector cells. TEM hippocampal cells include place and landmark cells that remap between environments. Crucially, TEM also aligns with empirically recorded representations in complex non-spatial tasks.

We focus on classes of models in which the external variable is compared with one or more feature vectors to extract a low-dimensional representation, the history of spiking and other variables are potentially incorporated, and these factors are nonlinearly transformed to predict the occurrences of spikes. We illustrate these techniques in application to datasets of different degrees of complexity. In particular, we address the fitting of models in the presence of strong correlations in the external variable, as occurs in natural sensory stimuli and in movement.

Although a number of areas in the human brain have been linked to social reasoning4,5 and its disruption across a variety of psychosocial disorders6-8, the basic cellular mechanisms that underlie human theory of mind remain undefined. Here, using recordings from single cells in the human dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, we identify neurons that reliably encode information about others' beliefs across richly varying scenarios and that distinguish self- from other-belief-related representations. By further following their encoding dynamics, we show how these cells represent the contents of the others' beliefs and accurately predict whether they are true or false. We also show how they track inferred beliefs from another's specific perspective and how their activities relate to behavioural performance.

However, emerging evidence suggests a possible role for ‘activity-silent’ synaptic mechanisms. This issue remains controversial because evidence for either view has largely depended on datasets that fail to capture single-trial population dynamics or on indirect measures of neuronal spiking. We addressed this by examining the dynamics of mnemonic information on single trials obtained from large, local populations of prefrontal neurons recorded simultaneously in monkeys performing a working memory task. We show that mnemonic information does not persist in the spiking activity of prefrontal neurons, but instead alternates between ‘On’ and ‘Off’ periods during memory delays. At the level of single neurons, Off periods are driven by a coordinated loss of selectivity for memoranda and a return of firing rates to baseline levels. Further exploiting the large-scale recordings, we asked whether the functional connectivity among large neuronal ensembles depended on information held in working memory. We show that mnemonic information is available in the pattern of ensemble connectivity during the memory delay in both On and Off periods of neuronal activity. Intermittent epochs of memoranda-specific spiking therefore coexist with activity-silent mechanisms to span memory delays. \#\#\# Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest.",

We found that the speed at which neural states evolve over time is inversely proportional to the statistical mean of the temporal distribution of an expected stimulus. This lawful relationship was evident across multiple experiments and held true during learning: when temporal statistics underwent covert changes, neural responses underwent predictable changes that reflected the new mean.

Simulations based on optimal feedback control (OFC) models demonstrated that ``deactivation'' of the control policy (reduction in feedback gain) and state estimation (reduction in Kalman gain) caused impairments similar to that observed for PMd and A5 cooling, respectively. Furthermore, combined deactivation of both cortical regions led to additive impairments of individual deactivations, whereas reducing the amount of cooling to PMd led to impairments in response speed but not spatial accuracy, both also predicted by OFC models. These results provide causal support that frontoparietal circuits beyond primary somatosensory and motor cortices are involved in generating goal-directed motor corrections.",

We construct and study a model in which each synapse has a cascade of states with different levels of plasticity, connected by metaplastic transitions. This cascade model combines high levels of memory storage with long retention times and significantly outperforms alternative models. As a result, we suggest that memory storage requires synapses with multiple states exhibiting dynamics over a wide range of timescales, and we suggest experimental tests of this hypothesis.",

Due to limited resources, the visual system achieves this by combining imperfect sensory information with a belief state about locations in a scene, resulting in systematic distortions and biases. These biases can be captured by a Bayesian model in which internal beliefs are expressed in a prior probability distribution over locations in a scene. We introduce a paradigm that enables us to measure these priors by iterating a simple memory task where the response of one participant becomes the stimulus for the next. This approach reveals an unprecedented richness and level of detail in these priors, suggesting a different way to think about biases in spatial memory. A prior distribution on locations in a visual scene can reflect the selective allocation of coding resources to different visual regions during encoding (``efficient encoding''). This selective allocation predicts that locations in the scene will be encoded with variable precision, in contrast to previous work that has assumed fixed encoding precision regardless of location. We demonstrate that perceptual biases covary with variations in discrimination accuracy, a finding that is aligned with simulations of our efficient encoding model but not the traditional fixed encoding view. This work demonstrates the promise of using nonparametric data-driven approaches that combine crowdsourcing with the careful curation of information transmission within social networks to reveal the hidden structure of shared visual representations.",

Grid cells, a key component of this system, fire in a characteristic hexagonal pattern of locations[3][3], and are organized in modules[4][4],[5][5] which collectively form a population code for the animal’s allocentric position[1][1],[6][6]–[8][7]. The invariance of the correlation structure of this population code across environments[9][8],[10][9] and behavioural states[11][10],[12][11], independently of specific sensory inputs, has pointed to intrinsic, recurrently connected continuous attractor networks (CANs) as a possible substrate of the grid pattern[1][1],[2][2],[13][12]–[16][13]. However, whether grid cell networks show continuous attractor dynamics, and how they interface with inputs from the environment, has remained elusive due to the small samples of cells obtained to date. Here we show, with simultaneous recordings from many hundreds of grid cells, and subsequent topological data analysis, that the joint activity of grid cells from an individual module resides on a toroidal manifold, as expected in a two-dimensional CAN. Positions on the torus correspond to the moving animal’s position in the environment. Individual cells are preferentially active at singular positions on the torus. Their positions are maintained, with minimal distortion, between environments and from wakefulness to sleep, as predicted by CAN models for grid cells but not by alternative feed-forward models where grid patterns are created from external inputs by Hebbian plasticity[17][14]–[22][15]. This demonstration of network dynamics on a toroidal manifold provides the first population-level visualization of CAN dynamics in grid cells. \#\#\# Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest.

Muscle activity is some readout of neural activity, yet it remains largely unchanged during preparation. Here we find that during preparation, while the monkey holds still, changes in motor cortical activity cancel out at the level of these population readouts. Motor cortex can thereby prepare the movement without prematurely causing it. Further, we found evidence that this mechanism also operates in dorsal premotor cortex, largely accounting for how preparatory activity is attenuated in primary motor cortex. Selective use of 'output-null' vs. 'output-potent' patterns of activity may thus help control communication to the muscles and between these brain areas.",

Across physical, eventive, and social domains, relations such as support, fit, cause, chase, and even socially interact are extracted rapidly, are impossible to ignore, and influence other perceptual processes.

Despite their biological inspiration and performance achievements, these systems differ from human intelligence in crucial ways. We review progress in cognitive science suggesting that truly human-like learning and thinking machines will have to reach beyond current engineering trends in both what they learn and how they learn it. Specifically, we argue that these machines should (1) build causal models of the world that support explanation and understanding, rather than merely solving pattern recognition problems; (2) ground learning in intuitive theories of physics and psychology to support and enrich the knowledge that is learned; and (3) harness compositionality and learning-to-learn to rapidly acquire and generalize knowledge to new tasks and situations.

This contingency discrimination was unrelated to the tuning of individual neurons, but was instead an emergent property of their coactivity. Contingency-discriminating patterns were reactivated offline after learning, and their reinstatement predicted trial-by-trial memory performance. Moreover, optogenetic suppression of inputs from the upstream CA3 region during learning impaired coactivity-based contingency information in the CA1 and subsequent dynamic memory retrieval.

  abstract = "The human motor system can rapidly adapt its motor output in response to errors. The prevailing theory of this process posits that the motor system adapts an internal forward model that predicts the consequences of outgoing motor commands and uses this forward model to plan future movements. However, despite clear evidence that adaptive forward models exist and are used to help track the state of the body, there is no definitive evidence that such models are used in movement planning. An alternative to the forward-model-based theory of adaptation is that movements are generated based on a learned policy that is adjusted over time by movement errors directly (``direct policy learning''). This learning mechanism could act in parallel with, but independent of, any updates to a predictive forward model. Forward-model-based learning and direct policy learning generate very similar predictions about behavior in conventional adaptation paradigms. However, across three experiments with human participants (N = 47, 26 female), we show that these mechanisms can be dissociated based on the properties of implicit adaptation under mirror-reversed visual feedback. Although mirror reversal is an extreme perturbation, it still elicits implicit adaptation; however, this adaptation acts to amplify rather than to reduce errors. We show that the pattern of this adaptation over time and across targets is consistent with direct policy learning but not forward-model-based learning. Our findings suggest that the forward-model-based theory of adaptation needs to be re-examined and that direct policy learning provides a more plausible explanation of implicit adaptation.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The ability of our brain to adapt movements in response to error is one of the most widely studied phenomena in motor learning. Yet, we still do not know the process by which errors eventually result in adaptation. It is known that the brain maintains and updates an internal forward model, which predicts the consequences of motor commands, and the prevailing theory of motor adaptation posits that this updated forward model is responsible for trial-by-trial adaptive changes. Here, we question this view and show instead that adaptation is better explained by a simpler process whereby motor output is directly adjusted by task errors. Our findings cast doubt on long-held beliefs about adaptation.",

Neural responses were heterogeneous, nonlinear, and complex, and they exhibited a remarkable form of temporal invariance: firing rate profiles were temporally scaled to match the produced intervals. Recording from downstream neurons in the caudate and from thalamic neurons projecting to the medial frontal cortex indicated that this phenomenon originates within cortical networks. Recurrent neural network models trained to perform the task revealed that temporal scaling emerges from nonlinearities in the network and that the degree of scaling is controlled by the strength of external input.

Considering the inherent uncertainty associated with estimates of speed and distance and the ability of human brain to combine different sources of information, we asked whether humans additionally rely on temporal cues. We found that humans actively integrate speed information with both explicit and implicit timing cues. Analysis of behavior in relation to a Bayesian model revealed that the additional temporal information helps subjects optimize their performance in the presence of measurement uncertainty. These findings suggest that brain’s timing mechanisms are actively engaged while interacting with dynamic stimuli.",

How the brain implements Bayes-optimal inference, however, remains poorly understood. Simple behavioral tasks suggest that the brain can flexibly represent probability distributions. An alternative view is that the brain relies on simple algorithms that can implement Bayes-optimal behavior only when the computational demands are low. To distinguish between these alternatives, we devised a task in which Bayes-optimal performance could not be matched by simple algorithms. We asked subjects to estimate and reproduce a time interval by combining prior information with one or two sequential measurements. In the domain of time, measurement noise increases with duration. This property takes the integration of multiple measurements beyond the reach of simple algorithms. We found that subjects were able to update their estimates using the second measurement but their performance was suboptimal, suggesting that they were unable to update full probability distributions. Instead, subjects' behavior was consistent with an algorithm that predicts upcoming sensory signals, and applies a nonlinear function to errors in prediction to update estimates. These results indicate that the inference strategies employed by humans may deviate from Bayes-optimal integration when the computational demands are high.",

For example, a tennis player might use an estimate of distance (d) and speed (v) to estimate TTC (TTC = d/v). However, the tennis player may instead estimate TTC as twice the time it takes for the ball to move from the serve line to the net line. This latter strategy does not rely on kinematics and instead computes TTC solely from temporal cues. Which of these two strategies do humans use to estimate TTC? Considering that both speed and time estimates are inherently uncertain and the ability of the human brain to combine different sources of information, we hypothesized that humans estimate TTC by integrating speed information with temporal cues. We evaluated this hypothesis systematically using psychophysics and Bayesian modeling. Results indicated that humans rely on both speed information and temporal cues and integrate them to optimize their TTC estimates when both cues are present.

To disambiguate potential mechanisms, we propose two analyses, namely, decoding the passage of time from neural data and computing the cumulative dimensionality of the neural trajectory over time. Time can be decoded with high precision in tasks where timing information is relevant and with lower precision when irrelevant for performing the task. Neural trajectories are always observed to be low-dimensional. In addition, our results further constrain the mechanisms underlying time encoding as we find that the linear ``ramping'' component of each neuron's firing rate strongly contributes to the slow timescale variations that make decoding time possible. These constraints rule out working memory models that rely on constant, sustained activity and neural networks with high-dimensional trajectories, like reservoir networks.

Signatures of these opposing factors were evident across populations of neurons in the dorsomedial frontal cortex (DMFC), DMFC-projecting neurons in the ventrolateral thalamus, and putative target of DMFC in the caudate. However, only in the thalamus were the performance-optimizing regulation of variability aligned to the slow performance-degrading memory fluctuations.

In addition, the explore/exploit trade-off encompasses elements of risk-taking and impulsivity-common behaviors in psychiatric disorders-and provides a novel framework for understanding these behaviors within an ecological context. Here we explain relevant concepts and some common paradigms used to measure explore/exploit decisions in the laboratory, review clinically relevant research on the neurobiology and neuroanatomy of explore/exploit decision making, and discuss how computational psychiatry can benefit from foraging theory.",

That information in turn allows curious decision makers to represent the structure of their environment, that is, to form cognitive maps. These cognitive maps then drive adaptive flexible behavior. Based on recent data, we propose that orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) play complementary roles in curiosity-driven learning. Specifically, we propose that (1) OFC tracks intrinsic value of information and incorporates new information into a cognitive map; and (2) dACC tracks the environmental demands and information availability to then use the cognitive map from OFC to guide behavior.",

Longer travel times reduced the gain of neural responses for choosing to stay in a patch and increased the firing rate threshold mandating patch-leaving.

By contrast, the dorsal mPFC exhibits neural responses to action outcomes, which results in either improving or abandoning the ongoing plan. Thus, the mPFC resolves the exploitation-exploration dilemma through a two-stage, predictive coding process: a proactive ventromedial stage that constructs the functional signification of upcoming action outcomes and a reactive dorsomedial stage that guides behavior in response to action outcomes.",

Individuals value information about uncertain future rewards, and do so for multiple reasons, including valuing resolution of uncertainty and overweighting desirable information. The brain motivates this information seeking by tapping into some of the same circuitry as primary rewards like food and water. However, it also employs cortex and basal ganglia circuitry that predicts and values information as distinct from primary reward.

Here, we show that administration of a drug that enhances dopamine function (dihydroxy-L-phenylalanine; L-DOPA) reduces the impact of valence on information-seeking. Specifically, while participants under Placebo sought more information about potential gains than losses, under L-DOPA this difference was not observed. The results provide new insight into the neurobiology of information-seeking and generates the prediction that abnormal dopaminergic function (such as in Parkinson's disease) will result in valence-dependent changes to information-seeking.",

While monkeys integrated information value with primary reward value to make their decisions, OFC neurons had no systematic tendency to integrate these variables, instead encoding them in orthogonal manners. These results suggest that the predominant role of the OFC is to encode variables relevant for learning, attention, and decision making, rather than integrating them into a single scale of value.

In previous work on information-seeking in animals, information generally predicts upcoming rewards, and animals' decisions may therefore be a byproduct of reinforcement processes. Here we get around this potential confound by taking advantage of macaques' ability to reason counterfactually (that is, about outcomes that could have occurred had the subject chosen differently). Specifically, macaques sacrificed fluid reward to obtain information about counterfactual outcomes. Moreover, their willingness to pay scaled with the information (Shannon entropy) offered by the counterfactual option.

That is, often our decisions depend on a higher level choice: whether to exploit well known but possibly suboptimal alternatives or to explore risky but potentially more profitable ones. How adaptive agents choose between exploitation and exploration remains an important and open question that has received relatively limited attention in the behavioural and brain sciences. The choice could depend on a number of factors, including the familiarity of the environment, how quickly the environment is likely to change and the relative value of exploiting known sources of reward versus the cost of reducing uncertainty through exploration. There is no known generally optimal solution to the exploration versus exploitation problem, and a solution to the general case may indeed not be possible. However, there have been formal analyses of the optimal policy under constrained circumstances. There have also been specific suggestions of how humans and animals may respond to this problem under particular experimental conditions as well as proposals about the brain mechanisms involved.

Participants adapted to assigned payoff conditions, performed better in smooth than in rough environments, and—surprisingly—sometimes performed equally well in short as in long search horizons.

Now the patterns of activity during sleep have also been found to reflect the order in which the cells fired during spatial exploration. This relation was reliably stronger for sleep after the behavioral session than before it; thus, the activity during sleep reflects changes produced by experience. This memory for temporal order of neuronal firing could be produced by an interaction between the temporal integration properties of long-term potentiation and the phase shifting of spike activity with respect to the hippocampal theta rhythm.",

The earliest of these subregions, the posterior lateral face patch (PL), has not been studied previously at the neurophysiological level. Perhaps not surprisingly, we found that PL contains a high concentration of ``face-selective'' cells when tested with standard image sets comparable to those used previously to define the region at the level of fMRI. However, we here report that several different image sets and analytical approaches converge to show that nearly all face-selective PL cells are driven by the presence of a single eye in the context of a face outline. Most strikingly, images containing only an eye, even when incorrectly positioned in an outline, drove neurons nearly as well as full-face images, and face images lacking only this feature led to longer latency responses. Thus, bottom-up face processing is relatively local and linearly integrates features-consistent with parts-based models-grounding investigation of how the presence of a face is first inferred in the IT face processing hierarchy.",

Neurological evidence strongly implicates a dedicated machinery for face processing in the human brain to explain the double dissociability of face- and object-recognition deficits. Furthermore, recent evidence shows that macaques too have specialized neural machinery for processing faces. Here we propose a unifying hypothesis, deduced from computational, neurological, fMRI, and single-unit experiments: that what makes face processing special is that it is gated by an obligatory detection process. We clarify this idea in concrete algorithmic terms and show how it can explain a variety of phenomena associated with face processing.",

In primate vision research, free viewing of complex images has elucidated novel neural responses, and free viewing in humans has helped discover attentional and behavioral impairments in patients with neurological disorders. In order to fully interpret data collected from free viewing of complex scenes, it is critical to better understand what aspects of the stimuli guide viewing behavior. To this end, we have developed a novel viewing behavior model called a Biased Correlated Random Walk (BCRW) to describe free viewing behavior during the exploration of complex scenes in monkeys. The BCRW can predict fixation locations better than bottom-up salience. Additionally, we show that the BCRW can be used to test hypotheses regarding specific attentional mechanisms. For example, we used the BCRW to examine the source of the central bias in fixation locations. Our analyses suggest that the central bias may be caused by a natural tendency to reorient the eyes toward the center of the stimulus, rather than a photographer's bias to center salient items in a scene. Taken together these data suggest that the BCRW can be used to further our understanding of viewing behavior and attention, and could be useful in optimizing stimulus and task design.",

Rhesus macaques provide an ideal model for understanding the mechanisms underlying social viewing behavior, but to date no comparable behavioral task has been developed for use in monkeys. Using a novel scene-viewing task, we monitored the gaze of three rhesus macaques while they freely viewed well-controlled composed social scenes and analyzed the time spent viewing objects and monkeys. In each of six behavioral sessions, monkeys viewed a set of 90 images (540 unique scenes) with each image presented twice. In two-thirds of the repeated scenes, either a monkey or an object was replaced with a novel item (manipulated scenes). When viewing a repeated scene, monkeys made longer fixations and shorter saccades, shifting from a rapid orienting to global scene contents to a more local analysis of fewer items. In addition to this repetition effect, in manipulated scenes, monkeys demonstrated robust memory by spending more time viewing the replaced items. By analyzing attention to specific scene content, we found that monkeys strongly preferred to view conspecifics and that this was not related to their salience in terms of low-level image features. A model-free analysis of viewing statistics found that monkeys that were viewed earlier and longer had direct gaze and redder sex skin around their face and rump, two important visual social cues. These data provide a quantification of viewing strategy, memory and social preferences in rhesus macaques viewing complex social scenes, and they provide an important baseline with which to compare to the effects of therapeutics aimed at enhancing social cognition.",

In addition, we found weaker but significant representations of context location in an area related to the orienting of attention (intraparietal sulcus, IPS) as well as a region related to scene processing (retrosplenial cortex, RSC). Importantly, the degree of agreement among 100 independent raters about the likely location to contain a target object in a scene correlated with LOC's ability to predict the contextual location while weaker but significant effects were found in IPS, RSC, the human motion area, and early visual areas (V1, V3v). When contextual information was made irrelevant to observers' behavioral task, the MVPA analysis of LOC and the other areas' activity ceased to predict the location of context. Thus, our findings suggest that the likely locations of targets in scenes are represented in various visual areas with LOC playing a key role in contextual guidance during visual search of objects in real scenes.",

Here we examined the hypothesis that random exploration is governed by the neuromodulatory locus coeruleus-norepinephrine system. We administered atomoxetine, a norepinephrine transporter blocker that increases extracellular levels of norepinephrine throughout the cortex, to 22 healthy human participants in a double-blind crossover design. We examined the effect of treatment on performance in a gambling task designed to produce distinct measures of directed exploration and random exploration. In line with our hypothesis we found an effect of atomoxetine on random, but not directed exploration. However, contrary to expectation, atomoxetine reduced rather than increased random exploration. We offer three potential explanations of our findings, involving the non-linear relationship between tonic NE and cognitive performance, the interaction of atomoxetine with other neuromodulators, and the possibility that atomoxetine affected phasic norepinephrine activity more so than tonic norepinephrine activity.",

In this paper, we propose a simple and scalable detection algorithm that improves mean average precision (mAP) by more than 30\% relative to the previous best result on VOC 2012---achieving a mAP of 53.3\%. Our approach combines two key insights: (1) one can apply high-capacity convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to bottom-up region proposals in order to localize and segment objects and (2) when labeled training data is scarce, supervised pre-training for an auxiliary task, followed by domain-specific fine-tuning, yields a significant performance boost. Since we combine region proposals with CNNs, we call our method R-CNN: Regions with CNN features. We also compare R-CNN to OverFeat, a recently proposed sliding-window detector based on a similar CNN architecture. We find that R-CNN outperforms OverFeat by a large margin on the 200-class ILSVRC2013 detection dataset. Source code for the complete system is available at http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~rbg/rcnn.",

In AI, this includes the development of computer programs that can beat a grandmaster at GO or outperform human radiologists at cancer detection. A great deal of these technological developments are directly related to progress in artificial neural networks-initially inspired by our knowledge about how the brain carries out computation. In parallel, neuroscience has also experienced significant advances in understanding the brain. For example, in the field of spatial navigation, knowledge about the mechanisms and brain regions involved in neural computations of cognitive maps-an internal representation of space-recently received the Nobel Prize in medicine. Much of the recent progress in neuroscience has partly been due to the development of technology used to record from very large populations of neurons in multiple regions of the brain with exquisite temporal and spatial resolution in behaving animals. With the advent of the vast quantities of data that these techniques allow us to collect there has been an increased interest in the intersection between AI and neuroscience, many of these intersections involve using AI as a novel tool to explore and analyze these large data sets. However, given the common initial motivation point-to understand the brain-these disciplines could be more strongly linked. Currently much of this potential synergy is not being realized. We propose that spatial navigation is an excellent area in which these two disciplines can converge to help advance what we know about the brain. In this review, we first summarize progress in the neuroscience of spatial navigation and reinforcement learning. We then turn our attention to discuss how spatial navigation has been modeled using descriptive, mechanistic, and normative approaches and the use of AI in such models. Next, we discuss how AI can advance neuroscience, how neuroscience can advance AI, and the limitations of these approaches. We finally conclude by highlighting promising lines of research in which spatial navigation can be the point of intersection between neuroscience and AI and how this can contribute to the advancement of the understanding of intelligent behavior.",

We show that the structure of a scene image can be estimated by the mean of global image features, providing a statistical summary of the spatial layout properties (Spatial Envelope representation) of the scene. Global features are based on configurations of spatial scales and are estimated without invoking segmentation or grouping operations.

MDPs provide a general framework for modeling tasks in which decisions affect the information on which future choices will be made. Under the assumption that agents are maximizing expected rewards, MDPs provide normative solutions. We find that all three classes of tasks pose choices among actions which trade-off immediate and future expected rewards. The tasks drive these trade-offs in unique ways, however. For bandit and information sampling tasks, increasing uncertainty or the time horizon shifts value to actions that pay-off in the future. Correspondingly, decreasing uncertainty increases the relative value of actions that pay-off immediately. For foraging tasks the time-horizon plays the dominant role, as choices do not affect future uncertainty in these tasks.",

Across various different probabilistic and heuristic models, we find evidence that Gaussian process function learning-combined with an optimistic upper confidence bound sampling strategy-provides a robust account of how people use generalization to guide search.

Search problems and their solutions also scale from individuals to societies, underlying and constraining problem solving, memory, information search, and scientific and cultural innovation. In summary, search represents a core feature of cognition, with a vast influence on its evolution and processes across contexts and requiring input from multiple domains to understand its implications and scope.",

This raises the possibility that monkeys evaluate sensory percepts in terms of their motor affordances rather than their abstract identity. It is not clear how monkeys can evaluate sensory percepts when unaware of the motor actions they bear upon. We investigated this by training monkeys to make perceptual decisions about the direction of motion in a noisy random-dot display. They learned to associate leftward and rightward with two colors, and to select from a pair of colored targets, which were displayed after the motion at unpredictable locations. Surprisingly we found that monkeys postpone decision formation until the pertinent motor actions are revealed. Neurons in parietal cortex represent the accumulation of evidence sampled from short term memory of the motion display. The findings demonstrate that abstract decisions are framed in terms of their motor affordances and highlight the capacity for integration of evidence from memory.",

The theory started with the rejection of the premise of the poverty of the stimulus, the physicalist conception of the stimulus, and the passive character of the perceiver of mainstream theories of perception. On the contrary, the main principles of ecological psychology are the continuity of perception and action, the organism-environment system as unit of analysis, the study of affordances as the objects of perception, combined with an emphasis on perceptual learning and development. In this paper, first, we analyze the philosophical and psychological influences of ecological psychology: pragmatism, behaviorism, phenomenology, and Gestalt psychology. Second, we summarize the main concepts of the approach and their historical development following the academic biographies of the proponents. Finally, we highlight the most significant developments of this psychological tradition. We conclude that ecological psychology is one of the most innovative approaches in the psychological field, as it is reflected in its current influence in the contemporary embodied and situated cognitive sciences, where the notion of affordance and the work of E.

Discrepant results by different laboratories may be due to the effects of different training regiments and tasks used in memory tasks. In order to address how training in a memory task alters neuronal responses, we performed recordings in monkeys that were never trained in memory tasks, but passively viewed visual stimuli. We have found that a population of prefrontal neurons responded to visual stimuli and also exhibited significantly elevated responses during ``delay'' intervals of the task. For a population of these neurons, persistent discharges were selective for the location and feature of the preceding stimulus. These discharges were typically disrupted by the appearance of a subsequent stimulus. Our results suggest that some prefrontal neurons represent the location and identity of visual stimuli in a persistent fashion, even when the latter are not behaviorally important or required to be kept in memory.",

We find that networks trained on object recognition perform poorly on face recognition and vice versa and that networks optimized for both tasks spontaneously segregate themselves into separate systems for faces and objects.

The responses of neurons in the primary visual cortex, V1, are relatively insensitive to the statistical information in these textures. However, in the area immediately downstream, V2, cells respond more vigorously to these stimuli than to matched control stimuli. Humans show blood-oxygen-level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging (BOLD fMRI responses in V1 and V2) that are consistent with the neuronal measurements in macaque. These fMRI measurements, as well as neurophysiological work by others, show that true natural scenes become a more prominent driving feature of cortex downstream from V2.

According to this idea, neurons encode stimuli through fixed mappings of stimulus features to firing rates. Here, we report that the tuning of visual neurons can rapidly and coherently change across a population to attend to a whole and its parts. We set out to investigate a longstanding debate concerning whether inferotemporal (IT) cortex uses a specialized code for representing specific types of objects or whether it uses a general code that applies to any object. We found that face cells in macaque IT cortex initially adopted a general code optimized for face detection. But following a rapid, concerted population event lasting < 20 ms, the neural code transformed into a face-specific one with two striking properties: (i) response gradients to principal detection-related dimensions reversed direction, and (ii) new tuning developed to multiple higher feature space dimensions supporting fine face discrimination. These dynamics were face specific and did not occur in response to objects. Overall, these results show that, for faces, face cells shift from detection to discrimination by switching from an object-general code to a face-specific code. More broadly, our results suggest a novel mechanism for neural representation: concerted, stimulus-dependent switching of the neural code used by a cortical area. \#\#\# Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest.

Furthermore, robust changes in DV sign have the statistical regularities expected from behavioural studies of changes of mind3.

Within this low-dimensional space, both physical and abstract variables were jointly mapped in an orderly manner, creating a geometric representation that we show is similar across mice. The existence of conjoined cognitive maps suggests that the hippocampus performs a general computation—the creation of task-specific low-dimensional manifolds that contain a geometric representation of learned knowledge.

Anatomical and functional evidence supports the idea that this hierarchy originates on the orbital surface of the brain and extends dorsally to motor cortex. Our view, therefore, positions the orbitofrontal cortex as the central site for the optimization of goal selection policies, and suggests that other proposed roles are aspects of this more general function. We conclude by proposing that the dynamical systems approach, which works well in motor systems, can be extended to the rest of prefrontal cortex.

Here, we relaxed the constraints associated with a purely categorical concept of ambiguity and varied the second-order uncertainty of gambles continuously, quantified as entropy over second-order probabilities. We show that second-order uncertainty influences decisions in a pessimistic way by biasing second-order probabilities, and that second-order uncertainty is negatively correlated with posterior cingulate cortex activity. The category of ambiguous (compared with nonambiguous) gambles also biased choice in a similar direction, but was associated with distinct activation of a posterior parietal cortical area; an activation that we show reflects a different computational mechanism.

Norepinephrine signals unexpected uncertainty, as when unsignaled context switches produce strongly unexpected observations. These uncertainty signals interact to enable optimal inference and learning in noisy and changeable environments. This formulation is consistent with a wealth of physiological, pharmacological, and behavioral data implicating acetylcholine and norepinephrine in specific aspects of a range of cognitive processes.

Several lines of evidence are beginning to elucidate different variants of uncertainty. Particularly, risk, ambiguity, and expected and unexpected forms of uncertainty are well articulated in the literature. In this article we review both empirical and theoretical evidence arguing for the potential distinction between three forms of uncertainty; expected uncertainty, unexpected uncertainty, and volatility. Particular attention will be devoted to exploring the distinction between unexpected uncertainty and volatility which has been less appreciated in the literature. This includes evidence mainly from neuroimaging, neuromodulation, and electrophysiological studies. We further address the possible differentiation of cognitive control mechanisms used to deal with these forms of uncertainty. Finally, we explore whether the dual modes of control theory provides a theoretical framework for understanding the distinction between unexpected uncertainty and volatility.",

In particular, models of decision-making emphasize the involvement of orbitofrontal cortices (OFC) and the medial wall. While decision-making has been studied broadly as a class of executive function, recent models have suggested the differentiation between risky and ambiguous decision-making. Given recent emphasis on the role of OFC in affectively laden ``hot'' executive function and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in more purely cognitive ``cool'' executive function, we hypothesize that the neural substrates of decision-making may differ depending on the nature of the decision required. To test this hypothesis, we used recently developed meta-analytic techniques to examine the existent functional neuroimaging literature. An initial meta-analysis of decision-making, both risky and ambiguous, found significantly elevated probabilities of activation in frontal and parietal regions, thalamus, and caudate. Ambiguous decision-making was associated with activity in DLPFC, regions of dorsal and subcallosal anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and parietal cortex. Risky decision-making was associated with activity in OFC, rostral portions of the ACC, and parietal cortex. Direct statistical comparisons revealed significant differences between risky and ambiguous decision-making in frontal regions, including OFC, DLPFC, and ACC, that were consistent with study hypotheses. These findings provide evidence for the dissociation of neural circuits underlying risky and ambiguous decision-making, reflecting differential involvement of affective ``hot'' and cognitive ``cool'' processes.",

This preference, formalized in economics, is strong enough that people will reliably prefer a risky option to an ambiguous option with a greater expected value. Explanations for ambiguity aversion often invoke uniquely human faculties like language, self-justification, or a desire to avoid public embarrassment. Challenging these ideas, here we demonstrate that a preference for unambiguous options is shared with rhesus macaques. We trained four monkeys to choose between pairs of options that both offered explicitly cued probabilities of large and small juice outcomes. We then introduced occasional trials where one of the options was obscured and examined their resulting preferences; we ran humans in a parallel experiment on a nearly identical task. We found that monkeys reliably preferred risky options to ambiguous ones, even when this bias was costly, closely matching the behavior of humans in the analogous task. Notably, ambiguity aversion varied parametrically with the extent of ambiguity. As expected, ambiguity aversion gradually declined as monkeys learned the underlying probability distribution of rewards. These data indicate that ambiguity aversion reflects fundamental cognitive biases shared with other animals rather than uniquely human factors guiding decisions.",

Previous neuroimaging studies of decision making have implicated regions of the medial frontal lobe in processes related to the resolution of uncertainty. However, a different set of regions in dorsal prefrontal and posterior parietal cortices has been reported to be critical for selection of actions to unexpected or unpredicted stimuli within a sequence. In the current study, we induced uncertainty using a novel task that required subjects to base their decisions on a binary sequence of eight stimuli so that uncertainty changed dynamically over time (from 20 to 50\%), depending on which stimuli were presented. Activation within prefrontal, parietal, and insular cortices increased with increasing uncertainty. In contrast, within medial frontal regions, as well as motor and visual cortices, activation did not increase with increasing uncertainty. We conclude that the brain response to uncertainty depends on the demands of the experimental task. When uncertainty depends on learned associations between stimuli and responses, as in previous studies, it modulates activation in the medial frontal lobes. However, when uncertainty develops over short time scales as information is accumulated toward a decision, dorsal prefrontal and posterior parietal contributions are critical for its resolution. The distinction between neural mechanisms subserving different forms of uncertainty resolution provides an important constraint for neuroeconomic models of decision making.",

Activation within the lateral prefrontal cortex was predicted by ambiguity preference and was also negatively correlated with an independent clinical measure of behavioral impulsiveness, suggesting that this region implements contextual analysis and inhibits impulsive responses. In contrast, activation of the posterior parietal cortex was predicted by risk preference. Together, this novel double dissociation indicates that decision making under ambiguity does not represent a special, more complex case of risky decision making; instead, these two forms of uncertainty are supported by distinct mechanisms.",

Using fMRI (n = 31), we find that relative uncertainty is represented in right rostrolateral prefrontal cortex and drives directed exploration, while total uncertainty is represented in right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and drives random exploration. The decision value signal combining relative and total uncertainty to compute choice is reflected in motor cortex activity. The variance of this signal scales with total uncertainty, consistent with a sampling mechanism for random exploration. Overall, these results are consistent with a hybrid computational architecture in which different uncertainty computations are performed separately and then combined by downstream decision circuits to compute choice.",

  abstract = "Cortical neurons exhibit tremendous variability in the number and temporal distribution of spikes in their discharge patterns. Furthermore, this variability appears to be conserved over large regions of the cerebral cortex, suggesting that it is neither reduced nor expanded from stage to stage within a processing pathway. To investigate the principles underlying such statistical homogeneity, we have analyzed a model of synaptic integration incorporating a highly simplified integrate and fire mechanism with decay. We analyzed a ``high-input regime'' in which neurons receive hundreds of excitatory synaptic inputs during each interspike interval. To produce a graded response in this regime, the neuron must balance excitation with inhibition. We find that a simple integrate and fire mechanism with balanced excitation and inhibition produces a highly variable interspike interval, consistent with experimental data. Detailed information about the temporal pattern of synaptic inputs cannot be recovered from the pattern of output spikes, and we infer that cortical neurons are unlikely to transmit information in the temporal pattern of spike discharge. Rather, we suggest that quantities are represented as rate codes in ensembles of 50-100 neurons. These column-like ensembles tolerate large fractions of common synaptic input and yet covary only weakly in their spike discharge. We find that an ensemble of 100 neurons provides a reliable estimate of rate in just one interspike interval (10-50 msec). Finally, we derived an expression for the variance of the neural spike count that leads to a stable propagation of signal and noise in networks of neurons-that is, conditions that do not impose an accumulation or diminution of noise. The solution implies that single neurons perform simple algebra resembling averaging, and that more sophisticated computations arise by virtue of the anatomical convergence of novel combinations of inputs to the cortical column from external sources.",

In real-world tasks, however, humans must generalize across a wide range of within-domain variation. In this work we argue that representational abstraction plays an important role in such within-domain generalization. We then explore the nature of this representational abstraction in realistically complex tasks like video games by demonstrating how the same model-based planning framework produces distinct generalization behaviors under different classes of task representation. Finally, we compare the behavior of agents with these task representations to humans in a series of novel grid-based video game tasks.

First, we incorporated non-Poisson spiking into both models and found that more neurons were better described by stepping than ramping, even when conditioned on evidence or choice. Second, we extended the ramping model to include a non-zero baseline and compressive output nonlinearity. This model accounted for roughly as many neurons as the stepping model. However, latent dynamics inferred under this model exhibited high diffusion variance for many neurons, softening the distinction between continuous and discrete dynamics. Results generalized to additional datasets, demonstrating that substantial fractions of neurons are well described by either stepping or nonlinear ramping, which may be less categorically distinct than the original labels implied.",

Using multivariate decoders, each successive location could be decoded from brain signals, and upcoming locations were anticipated prior to their actual onset. Crucially, sequences with lower complexity, defined as the minimal description length provided by the formal language, led to lower error rates and to increased anticipations. Furthermore, neural codes specific to the numerical and geometrical primitives of the postulated language could be detected, both in isolation and within the sequences. These results suggest that the human brain detects sequence regularities at multiple nested levels and uses them to compress long sequences in working memory.",

Whilst a frontal-hippocampal circuit is known to be essential for this task, little is known about the associated neuronal computations. Visual understanding appears superficially distinct from other known functions of this circuit, such as spatial reasoning and model-based planning, but recent models suggest deeper computational similarities. Here, using fMRI, we show that representations of a simple visual scene in these brain regions are relational and compositional – key computational properties theorised to support rapid construction of hippocampal maps. Using MEG, we show that rapid sequences of representations, akin to replay in spatial navigation and planning problems, are also engaged in visual construction. Whilst these sequences have previously been proposed as mechanisms to plan possible futures or learn from the past, here they are used to understand the present. Replay sequences form constructive hypotheses about possible scene configurations. These hypotheses play out in an optimal order for relational inference, progressing from predictable to uncertain scene elements, gradually constraining possible configurations, and converging on the correct scene configuration. Together, these results suggest a computational bridge between apparently distinct functions of hippocampal-prefrontal circuitry, and a role for generative replay in constructive inference and hypothesis testing. \#\#\# Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest.",

Finally, in contrast to the persisting view of the mind as a highly plastic blank slate ready for the world to make its imprint, we hypothesize that neuronal networks are endowed with a reservoir of neural trajectories, and the challenge faced by the brain is how to select and match preexisting neuronal trajectories with events in the world.",

We scour our environments for territory, food, mates, and information. We search for items in visual scenes, for historical facts, and for the best deals on Internet sites; we search for new friends to add to our social networks, and for solutions to novel problems. What we find is always governed by how we search and by the structure of the environment. This book explores how we search for resources in our minds and in the world. The authors examine the evolution and adaptive functions of search; the neural underpinnings of goal-searching mechanisms across species; psychological models of search in memory, decision making, and visual scenes; and applications of search behavior in highly complex environments such as the Internet. As the range of information, social contacts, and goods continues to expand, how well we are able to search and successfully find what we seek becomes increasingly important. At the same time, search offers cross-disciplinary insights to the scientific study of human cognition and its evolution. Combining perspectives from researchers across numerous domains, this book furthers our understanding of the relationship between search and the human mind.",

As a result, for 40 years, researchers have endeavored to determine whether ToM is itself unique to humans. Investigations in other species (e.g., apes, monkeys, corvids) are essential to understand the mechanistic underpinnings and evolutionary origins of this capacity across taxa, including humans. We review the literature on ToM in nonhuman animals, suggesting that some species share foundational social cognitive mechanisms with humans. We focus principally on innovations of the last decade and pressing directions for future work. Underexplored types of social cognition have been targeted, including ascription of mental states, such as desires and beliefs, that require simultaneously representing one's own and another's conflicting motives or views of the world. Ongoing efforts probe the motivational facets of ToM, how flexibly animals can recruit social cognitive skills across cooperative and competitive settings, and appropriate motivational contexts for comparative inquiry. Finally, novel methodological and empirical approaches have brought new species (e.g., lemurs, dogs) into the lab, implemented critical controls to elucidate underlying mechanisms, and contributed powerful new techniques (e.g., looking-time, eye-tracking) that open the door to unexplored approaches for studying animal minds. These innovations in cognition, motivation, and method promise fruitful progress in the years to come, in understanding the nature and origin of ToM in humans and other species.

We find spontaneous gaze bias of macaques implicitly anticipating others' FB-driven actions. Silencing of the medial prefrontal neuronal activity with inhibitory designer receptor exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs) specifically eliminates the implicit gaze bias while leaving the animals' visually guided and memory-guided tracking abilities intact. Thus, neuronal activity in the medial prefrontal cortex could have a causal role in FB-attribution-like behaviors in the primate lineage, emphasizing the importance of probing the neuronal mechanisms underlying theory of mind with relevant macaque animal models.",

Mixed population predictions of the other was remarkably near optimal compared to behavioral decoders. Moreover, disrupting cingulate activity selectively biased mutually beneficial interactions between the monkeys but, surprisingly, had no influence on their decisions when no net-positive outcome was possible.

Dynamic activities converted these values to representations of the recorded monkey's own choices. Surprisingly, the same activity patterns unfolded spontaneously before partner's choices in separate neurons, as if these neurons simulated the partner's decision-making. These ``simulation neurons'' encoded signatures of mutual-inhibitory decision computation, including value comparisons and value-to-choice conversions, resulting in accurate predictions of partner's choices. Population decoding identified differential contributions of amygdala subnuclei. Biophysical modeling of amygdala circuits showed that simulation neurons emerge naturally from convergence between object-value neurons and self-other neurons.

Nonetheless, the academic study of decision-making is mostly limited to the simple case of choice between two options. Here, we advocate that the study of choice should expand to include continuous decisions. Continuous decisions, by our definition, involve a continuum of possible responses and take place over an extended period of time during which the response is continuously subject to modification. In most continuous decisions, the range of options can fluctuate and is affected by recent responses, making consideration of reciprocal feedback between choices and the environment essential. The study of continuous decisions raises new questions, such as how abstract processes of valuation and comparison are co-implemented with action planning and execution, how we simulate the large number of possible futures our choices lead to, and how our brains employ hierarchical structure to make choices more efficiently. While microeconomic theory has proven invaluable for discrete decisions, we propose that engineering control theory may serve as a better foundation for continuous ones. And while the concept of value has proven foundational for discrete decisions, goal states and policies may prove more useful for continuous ones.

However, exhaustive planning is intractable because the number of possible action sequences increases exponentially with the number of steps that one plans ahead. Understanding how people are nevertheless able to solve novel problems when their actions have long-reaching consequences is thus critical to understanding human intelligence. Progress in answering this question has been hampered by two challenges: planning cannot be observed and we do not have a good framework for formalizing the tradeoff between performance and computational cost. In this work, we propose solutions to both challenges, based on the idea that planning can be conceptualized as information seeking. Specifically, we model planning as the selection of information-generating computations and introduce an experimental paradigm in which these computations are externalized as mouse clicks. We find that our participants' behavior is broadly consistent with the optimal information-seeking model. We also uncover systematic deviations that might result from heuristic approximations or additional cognitive constraints that have yet to be uncovered.",

Gambling on a long shot, whether a horse at the racetrack or a foreign oil company in a hedge fund, can have negative consequences, but the impact of uncertainty on decision making extends beyond gambling. Indeed, uncertainty in some form pervades nearly all our choices in daily life. Stepping into traffic to hail a cab, braving an ice storm to be the first at work, or dating the boss's son or daughter also offer potentially great windfalls, at the expense of surety. We continually face trade-offs between options that promise safety and others that offer an uncertain potential for jackpot or bust. When mechanisms for dealing with uncertain outcomes fail, as in mental disorders such as problem gambling or addiction, the results can be disastrous.

  abstract = "A fundamental problem faced by animals is learning to select actions based on noisy sensory information and incomplete knowledge of the world. It has been suggested that the brain engages in Bayesian inference during perception but how such probabilistic representations are used to select actions has remained unclear. Here we propose a neural model of action selection and decision making based on the theory of partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs). Actions are selected based not on a single ``optimal'' estimate of state but on the posterior distribution over states (the ``belief'' state). We show how such a model provides a unified framework for explaining experimental results in decision making that involve both information gathering and overt actions. The model utilizes temporal difference (TD) learning for maximizing expected reward. The resulting neural architecture posits an active role for the neocortex in belief computation while ascribing a role to the basal ganglia in belief representation, value computation, and action selection. When applied to the random dots motion discrimination task, model neurons representing belief exhibit responses similar to those of LIP neurons in primate neocortex. The appropriate threshold for switching from information gathering to overt actions emerges naturally during reward maximization. Additionally, the time course of reward prediction error in the model shares similarities with dopaminergic responses in the basal ganglia during the random dots task. For tasks with a deadline, the model learns a decision making strategy that changes with elapsed time, predicting a collapsing decision threshold consistent with some experimental studies. The model provides a new framework for understanding neural decision making and suggests an important role for interactions between the neocortex and the basal ganglia in learning the mapping between probabilistic sensory representations and actions that maximize rewards.",

A flutter stimulus activates neurons in the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) that somatotopically map to the site of stimulation. A subset of these neurons-those with quickly adapting properties, associated with Meissner's corpuscles-are strongly entrained by periodic flutter vibrations, firing with a probability that oscillates at the input frequency. Hence, quickly adapting neurons provide a dynamic representation of such flutter stimuli. However, are these neurons directly involved in the perception of flutter? Here we investigate this in monkeys trained to discriminate the difference in frequency between two flutter stimuli delivered sequentially on the fingertips. Microelectrodes were inserted into area 3b of S1 and the second stimulus was substituted with a train of injected current pulses. Animals reliably indicated whether the frequency of the second (electrical) signal was higher or lower than that of the first (mechanical) signal, even though both frequencies changed from trial to trial. Almost identical results were obtained with periodic and aperiodic stimuli of equal average frequencies. Thus, the quickly adapting neurons in area 3b activate the circuit leading to the perception of flutter. Furthermore, as far as can be psychophysically quantified during discrimination, the neural code underlying the sensation of flutter can be finely manipulated, to the extent that the behavioural responses produced by natural and artificial stimuli are indistinguishable.",

  abstract = "Humans and monkeys have similar abilities to discriminate the difference in frequency between two mechanical vibrations applied sequentially to the fingertips. A key component of this sensory task is that the second stimulus is compared with the trace left by the first (base) stimulus, which must involve working memory. Where and how is this trace held in the brain? This question was investigated by recording from single neurons in the prefrontal cortex of monkeys while they performed the somatosensory discrimination task. Here we describe neurons in the inferior convexity of the prefrontal cortex whose discharge rates varied, during the delay period between the two stimuli, as a monotonic function of the base stimulus frequency. We describe this as 'monotonic stimulus encoding', and we suggest that the result may generalize: monotonic stimulus encoding may be the basic representation of one-dimensional sensory stimulus quantities in working memory. Thus we predict that other behavioural tasks that require ordinal comparisons between scalar analogue stimuli would give rise to monotonic responses similar to those reported here.",

This discovery opens the way to a much better understanding of human episodic memory, for episodic memory prototypically involves a memory of where people or objects or rewards have been seen in locations ``out there'' which could never be implemented by the place cells that encode the location of a rat or mouse. Further, spatial view cells are valuable for navigation using vision and viewed landmarks, and provide for much richer, vision-based, navigation than the place to place self-motion update performed by rats and mice who live in dark underground tunnels. Spatial view cells thus offer a revolution in our understanding of the functions of the hippocampus in memory and navigation in humans and other primates with well-developed foveate vision. The second discovery describes a computational theory of the hippocampal-neocortical memory system that includes the only quantitative theory of how information is recalled from the hippocampus to the neocortex. It is shown how foundations for this research were the discovery of reward neurons for food reward, and non-reward, in the primate orbitofrontal cortex, and representations of value including of monetary value in the human orbitofrontal cortex; and the discovery of face identity and face expression cells in the primate inferior temporal visual cortex and how they represent transform-invariant information. This research illustrates how in order to understand a brain computation, a whole series of integrated interdisciplinary discoveries is needed to build a theory of the operation of each neural system.",

These ``preparatory states'' largely determine the subsequent evolution of both neural activity and behavior, and their importance raises questions regarding how they are, or ought to be, set. Here, we formulate motor preparation as optimal anticipatory control of future movements and show that the solution requires a form of internal feedback control of cortical circuit dynamics. In contrast to a simple feedforward strategy, feedback control enables fast movement preparation by selectively controlling the cortical state in the small subspace that matters for the upcoming movement. Feedback but not feedforward control explains the orthogonality between preparatory and movement activity observed in reaching monkeys. We propose a circuit model in which optimal preparatory control is implemented as a thalamo-cortical loop gated by the basal ganglia.",

We report neurons that fire persistently during the delay period, with a firing rate that is a monotonic function of the frequency of the first stimulus.

Neurological evidence strongly implicates a dedicated machinery for face processing in the human brain to explain the double dissociability of face- and object-recognition deficits.

Here we propose a unifying hypothesis, deduced from computational, neurological, fMRI, and single-unit experiments: that what makes face processing special is that it is gated by an obligatory detection process.

We found that preparation time was inversely correlated to variance of errors on current trials and mean error on subsequent trials. We also found causal evidence that intracortical microstimulation during motor preparation was sufficient to disrupt learning. Surprisingly, stimulation did not affect current trials, but instead disrupted the update computation of a learning process, thereby affecting subsequent trials. This is consistent with a Bayesian estimation framework where the motor system reduces its learning rate by virtue of lowering error sensitivity when faced with uncertainty. This interaction between motor preparation and the error-driven learning system may facilitate new probes into mechanisms underlying trial-by-trial adaptation.",

We found that in a neural subspace predictive of hand forces, changes in preparatory activity tracked the learned behavioural modifications and reassociated4 existing activity patterns with updated movements. Along a neural population dimension orthogonal to the force-predictive subspace, we discovered that preparatory activity shifted uniformly for all movement directions, including those unaltered by learning. During a washout period when the curl field was removed, preparatory activity gradually reverted in the force-predictive subspace, but the uniform shift persisted. These persistent preparatory activity patterns may retain a motor memory of the learned field5,6 and support accelerated relearning of the same curl field. When a set of distinct curl fields was learned in sequence, we observed a corresponding set of field-specific uniform shifts which separated the associated motor memories in the neural state space7-9. The precise geometry of these uniform shifts in preparatory activity could serve to index motor memories, facilitating the acquisition, retention and retrieval of a broad motor repertoire.",

Here, we demonstrate an implant and imaging system capable of chronic, motion-stabilized two-photon imaging of neuronal calcium signals from macaques engaged in a motor task. By imaging apical dendrites, we achieved optical access to large populations of deep and superficial cortical neurons across dorsal premotor (PMd) and gyral primary motor (M1) cortices. Dendritic signals from individual neurons displayed tuning for different directions of arm movement. Combining several technical advances, we developed an optical BCI (oBCI) driven by these dendritic signalswhich successfully decoded movement direction online. By fusing two-photon functional imaging with CLARITY volumetric imaging, we verified that many imaged dendrites which contributed to oBCI decoding originated from layer 5 output neurons, including a putative Betz cell. This approach establishes new opportunities for studying motor control and designing BCIs via two photon imaging.",

  abstract = "The problem of planning under uncertainty has received significant attention in the scientific community over the past few years. It is now well-recognized that considering uncertainty during planning and decision-making is imperative to the design of robust computer systems. This is particularly crucial in robotics, where the ability to interact effectively with real-world environments is a prerequisite for success. The Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) provides a rich framework for planning under uncertainty. The POMDP model can optimize sequences of actions which are robust to sensor noise, missing information, occlusion, as well as imprecise actuators. While the model is sufficiently rich to address most robotic planning problems, exact solutions are generally intractable for all but the smallest problems. This thesis argues that large POMDP problems can be solved by exploiting natural structural constraints. In support of this, we propose two distinct but complementary algorithms which overcome tractability issues in POMDP planning. PBVI is a sample-based approach which approximates a value function solution by planning over a small number of salient information states. PolCA+ is a hierarchical approach which leverages structural properties of a problem to decompose it into a set of smaller, easy-to-solve, problems. These techniques improve the tractability of POMDP planning to the point where POMDP-based robot controllers are a reality. This is demonstrated through the successful deployment of a nursing assistant robot.",

Thus it seems natural to try to unify offline and online techniques, preserving the theoretical properties of the former, and exploiting the scalability of the latter. In this paper, we provide theoretical guarantees on an anytime algorithm for POMDPs which aims to reduce the error made by approximate offline value iteration algorithms through the use of an efficient online searching procedure. The algorithm uses search heuristics based on an error analysis of lookahead search, to guide the online search towards reachable beliefs with the most potential to reduce error. We provide a general theorem showing that these search heuristics are admissible, and lead to complete and ε-optimal algorithms. This is, to the best of our knowledge, the strongest theoretical result available for online POMDP solution methods. We also provide empirical evidence showing that our approach is also practical, and can find (provably) near-optimal solutions in reasonable time.",

The face patches were embedded within a large swath of object-selective cortex extending from V4 to rostral TE. This large region responded better to pictures of intact objects compared to scrambled objects, with different object categories eliciting different patterns of activity, as in the human.

Traditional neurophysiological approaches record the activities of one neuron or a few neurons at a time. Neurochemical approaches focus on single neurotransmitters. Yet, there is an increasing realization that neural circuits operate at emergent levels, where the interactions between hundreds or thousands of neurons, utilizing multiple chemical transmitters, generate functional states. Brains function at the nanoscale, so tools to study brains must ultimately operate at this scale, as well. Nanoscience and nanotechnology are poised to provide a rich toolkit of novel methods to explore brain function by enabling simultaneous measurement and manipulation of activity of thousands or even millions of neurons.

In this Nano Focus, we discuss how recent developments in nanoscale analysis tools and in the design and synthesis of nanomaterials have generated optical, electrical, and chemical methods that can readily be adapted for use in neuroscience. These approaches represent exciting areas of technical development and research. Moreover, unique opportunities exist for nanoscientists, nanotechnologists, and other physical scientists and engineers to contribute to tackling the challenging problems involved in understanding the fundamentals of brain function.",

We set out to investigate a longstanding debate concerning whether inferotemporal (IT) cortex uses a specialized code for representing specific types of objects or whether it uses a general code that applies to any object. We found that face cells in macaque IT cortex initially adopted a general code optimized for face detection. But following a rapid, concerted population event lasting < 20 ms, the neural code transformed into a face-specific one with two striking properties: (i) response gradients to principal detection-related dimensions reversed direction, and (ii) new tuning developed to multiple higher feature space dimensions supporting fine face discrimination. These dynamics were face specific and did not occur in response to objects. Overall, these results show that, for faces, face cells shift from detection to discrimination by switching from an object-general code to a face-specific code. More broadly, our results suggest a novel mechanism for neural representation: concerted, stimulus-dependent switching of the neural code used by a cortical area.",

At the beginning of each trial, to-be-classified images were not visible. Monkeys touched the image area to incrementally brighten the image, referred to as the brighten response. The amount by which brightness increased with each brighten response was unpredictable, and the monkeys could choose to classify the images at any time during a trial. We hypothesized that if monkeys monitored the status of their classification decision then they would seek information depending on the amount of information available. In Experiment 1, monkeys rarely used the brighten response when images were bright initially, and they used the brighten response more when earlier uses in a given trial yielded smaller amounts of information. In Experiment 2, monkeys made more brighten responses when the presented image did not belong in any of the trained categories, suggesting monkeys were sensitive to the fact that they could not reach a classification decision despite the image brightening. In Experiment 3, we found that the probability that monkeys used the brighten response correlated with their ability to correctly classify when the brighten response was not available. These findings add to the literature documenting the metacognitive skills of nonhuman primates by demonstrating an iterative feedback loop between cognitive monitoring and cognitive control that allows for adaptive information-seeking behavior.",

During animal evolution, the water-to-land transition resulted in a massive increase in visual range. Simulations of behavior identify a specific type of terrestrial habitat, clustered open and closed areas (savanna-like), where the advantage of planning peaks. Our computational experiments demonstrate how this patchy terrestrial structure, in combination with enhanced visual range, can reveal and hide agents as a function of their movement and create a selective benefit for imagining, evaluating, and selecting among possible future scenarios-in short, for planning.

To distinguish these approaches in humans, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging in a continuous spatial navigation task, in which frequent changes to the layout of the maze forced subjects continually to relearn their favored routes, thereby exposing the RL mechanisms used. We sought evidence for the neural substrates of such mechanisms by comparing choice behavior and blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signals to decision variables extracted from simulations of either algorithm. Both choices and value-related BOLD signals in striatum, although most often associated with TD learning, were better explained by the model-based theory. Furthermore, predecessor quantities for the model-based value computation were correlated with BOLD signals in the medial temporal lobe and frontal cortex. These results point to a significant extension of both the computational and anatomical substrates for RL in the brain.",

We have an astonishing capacity to remember the details of visual scenes even after a single, fleeting experience. This ability is thought to rely in part on experience-dependent changes in the primate inferotemporal cortex (IT). Single neurons in IT encode visual familiarity by discriminating between novel and familiar stimuli, with stronger neural activity on average for novel images. However, key open questions are to understand how neural encoding in IT changes as images progress from novel to highly familiar, and what learning rules and computations can account for learning-dependent changes in IT activity. Here, we investigate the timescales over which novel stimuli become familiar by recording in IT as initially novel images become increasingly familiar both within and across days. We identified salient and persistent memory-related signals in IT that spanned multiple timescales of minutes, hours, and days. Average neural activity progressively decreased with familiarity as firing rates were strongest for novel, weaker for intermediately familiar, and weakest for highly familiar images. Neural signatures of familiarity learning were slow to develop as response reductions to initially-novel images emerged gradually over multiple days (or hundreds of views) of visual experience. In addition to slow changes that emerged across sessions, neural responses to novel images showed rapid decreases with familiarity within single sessions. To gain insight into the mechanisms underlying changes of visual responses with familiarity, we use computational modeling to investigate which plasticity rules are consistent with these changes. Learning rules inferred from the neural data revealed a strong diversity with many neurons following a ‘negative’ plasticity rule as they exhibited synaptic depression over the course of learning across multiple days. A recurrent network model with two plasticity time constants – a slow time constant for long timescales and a fast time constant for short timescales – captured key dynamic features accompanying the transition from novel to familiar, including a gradual decrease in firing rates over multiple sessions, and a rapid decrease in firing rates within single sessions. Our findings suggest that distinct and complementary plasticity rules operating at different timescales may underlie the inferotemporal code for visual familiarity.",

Here, we first review studies that examine the anatomical basis for motor consolidation. Evidence implicates cerebellar circuitry in two types of associative motor learning--eyelid conditioning and vestibulo-ocular reflex adaptation--and implicates primary motor cortex in skilled finger movements.

We formalize a Bayesian model of hierarchy discovery that explains how humans discover such useful abstractions. Building on principles developed in structure learning and robotics, the model predicts that hierarchy discovery should be sensitive to the topological structure, reward distribution, and distribution of tasks in the environment. In five simulations, we show that the model accounts for previously reported effects of environment structure on planning behavior, such as detection of bottleneck states and transitions. We then test the novel predictions of the model in eight behavioral experiments, demonstrating how the distribution of tasks and rewards can influence planning behavior via the discovered hierarchy, sometimes facilitating and sometimes hindering performance. We find evidence that the hierarchy discovery process unfolds incrementally across trials. Finally, we propose how hierarchy discovery and hierarchical planning might be implemented in the brain. Together, these findings present an important advance in our understanding of how the brain might use Bayesian inference to discover and exploit the hidden hierarchical structure of the environment.",

While choices and neural correlates of decision variables sometimes reflect knowledge of their consequences, it remains unclear whether this actually arises from prospective evaluation. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging and a sequential reward-learning task in which paths contained decodable object categories, we found that humans' model-based choices were associated with neural signatures of future paths observed at decision time, suggesting a prospective mechanism for choice. Prospection also covaried with the degree of model-based influences on neural correlates of decision variables and was inversely related to prediction error signals thought to underlie model-free learning.

This prioritization balances two desiderata: the need to evaluate imminent choices versus the gain from propagating newly encountered information to preceding locations. Our theory offers a simple explanation for numerous findings about place cells; unifies seemingly disparate proposed functions of replay including planning, learning, and consolidation; and posits a mechanism whose dysfunction may underlie pathologies like rumination and craving.

Here, we investigated a potential role for Pavlovian approach in biasing which information humans will choose to sample. We collected a large novel dataset from 32,445 human subjects, making over 3 million decisions, who played a gambling task designed to measure the latent causes and extent of information-sampling biases. We identified three novel approach-related biases, formalized by comparing subject behavior to a dynamic programming model of optimal information gathering. These biases reflected the amount of information sampled (``positive evidence approach''), the selection of which information to sample (``sampling the favorite''), and the interaction between information sampling and subsequent choices (``rejecting unsampled options''). The prevalence of all three biases was related to a Pavlovian approach-avoid parameter quantified within an entirely independent economic decision task. Our large dataset also revealed that individual differences in the amount of information gathered are a stable trait across multiple gameplays and can be related to demographic measures, including age and educational attainment. As well as revealing limitations in cognitive processing, our findings suggest information sampling biases reflect the expression of primitive, yet potentially ecologically adaptive, behavioral repertoires. One such behavior is sampling from options that will eventually be chosen, even when other sources of information are more pertinent for guiding future action.",

Single-unit recordings in behaving monkeys reveal that decisions to check for additional information first engage midcingulate cortex and then lateral prefrontal cortex. The opposite is true for instructed decisions. Importantly, deciding to check engages neurons also involved in performance monitoring. Further, specific midcingulate activity could be discerned several trials before the monkeys actually choose to check the environment.

To illustrate these points, we focus our discussion on visual selective attention. It is argued that selectivity in processing has emerged through evolution as a design feature of a complex multi-channel sensorimotor system, which generates selective phenomena of ``attention'' as one of many by-products. Instead of the traditional analytic approach to attention, we suggest a synthetic approach that starts with well-understood mechanisms that do not need to be dedicated to attention, and yet account for the selectivity phenomena under investigation. We conclude that what would serve scientific progress best would be to drop the term ``attention'' as a label for a specific functional or neural system and instead focus on behaviorally relevant selection processes and the many systems that implement them.",

In the primate, researchers have argued from both behavioral and neural evidence that a key step in visual representation is 'figure-ground segmentation', the delineation of figures as distinct from backgrounds. To determine if mice also show behavioral and neural signatures of figure-ground segmentation, we trained mice on a figure-ground segmentation task where figures were defined by gratings and naturalistic textures moving counterphase to the background. Unlike primates, mice were severely limited in their ability to segment figure from ground using the opponent motion cue, with segmentation behavior strongly dependent on the specific carrier pattern. Remarkably, when mice were forced to localize naturalistic patterns defined by opponent motion, they adopted a strategy of brute force memorization of texture patterns. In contrast, primates, including humans, macaques, and mouse lemurs, could readily segment figures independent of carrier pattern using the opponent motion cue. Consistent with mouse behavior, neural responses to the same stimuli recorded in mouse visual areas V1, RL, and LM also did not support texture-invariant segmentation of figures using opponent motion. Modeling revealed that the texture dependence of both the mouse's behavior and neural responses could be explained by a feedforward neural network lacking explicit segmentation capabilities. These findings reveal a fundamental limitation in the ability of mice to segment visual objects compared to primates.",

Overall, we believe hippocampal replay training generative models provides a comprehensive account of memory construction, imagination and consolidation.

Our spiking neural network model yielded testable predictions: memories transition from unselective to selective as neurons drop out of and drop into engrams; inhibitory activity during recall is essential for memory selectivity; and inhibitory synaptic plasticity during memory consolidation is critical for engrams to become selective. Using activity-dependent labeling, longitudinal calcium imaging and a combination of optogenetic and chemogenetic manipulations in mouse dentate gyrus, we conducted contextual fear conditioning experiments that supported our model’s predictions. Our results reveal that memory engrams are dynamic and that changes in engram composition mediated by inhibitory plasticity are crucial for the emergence of memory selectivity.

Each monkey experienced one of four conditions, observing a human appearing to hide a food reward in an apparatus consisting of either one or two tubes. The monkeys tended to search the correct location when they observed this baiting event, but engaged in information seeking-by peering into a center location where they could check both potential hiding spots-if their view had been occluded and information seeking was possible. The monkeys only occasionally approached the center when information seeking was not possible.

We approach the question of curiosity by comparing reinforcement learning (RL) agents using models of curiosity in environments of controlled complexity such as Hopfield networks. We find that greedy agents are inferior to curious ones in certain complex environments (where high reward strategies may be harder to find). However, when environments are too complex or noisy, curiosity imparts less benefit. These findings suggest that curiosity is useful in a window of intermediate environmental complexity.",

However, a systematic investigation comparing this model to other computational models, especially convolutional neural network models that have shown success in explaining neural responses in the ventral visual stream, has been lacking. Here, we recorded responses of cells in the most anterior face patch anterior medial (AM) to a large set of real face images and compared a large number of models for explaining neural responses. We found that the active appearance model better explained responses than any other model except CORnet-Z, a feedforward deep neural network trained on general object classification to classify non-face images, whose performance it tied on some face image sets and exceeded on others. Surprisingly, deep neural networks trained specifically on facial identification did not explain neural responses well. A major reason is that units in the network, unlike neurons, are less modulated by face-related factors unrelated to facial identification, such as illumination.",

Well-known experimental results have revealed specialized cell types in MEC \---| e.g. grid, border, and head-direction cells \---| whose highly stereotypical response profiles are suggestive of the role they might play in supporting MEC functionality. However, the majority of MEC neurons do not exhibit stereotypical firing patterns. How should the response profiles of these more ``heterogeneous'' cells be described, and how do they contribute to behavior? In this work, we took a computational approach to addressing these questions. We first performed a statistical analysis that shows that heterogeneous MEC cells are just as reliable in their response patterns as the more stereotypical cell types, suggesting that they have a coherent functional role. Next, we evaluated a spectrum of candidate models in terms of their ability to describe the response profiles of both stereotypical and heterogeneous MEC cells. We found that recently developed task-optimized neural network models are substantially better than traditional grid cell-centric models at matching most MEC neuronal response profiles \---| including those of grid cells themselves \---| despite not being explicitly trained for this purpose. Specific choices of network architecture (such as gated nonlinearities and an explicit intermediate place cell representation) have an important effect on the ability of the model to generalize to novel scenarios, with the best of these models closely approaching the noise ceiling of the data itself. We then performed ``in-silica'' experiments on this model to address questions involving the relative functional relevance of various cell types, finding that heterogeneous cells are likely to be just as involved in downstream functional outcomes (such as path integration) as grid and border cells. Finally, inspired by recent data showing that, going beyond their spatial response selectivity, MEC cells are also responsive to non-spatial rewards, we introduce a new MEC model that performs reward-modulated path integration. We find that this unified model matches neural recordings across all variable-reward conditions. Taken together, our results point toward a conceptually principled goal-driven modeling approach for moving future experimental and computational efforts beyond overly-simplistic single-cell stereotypes. \#\#\# Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest.",

We pose the problem of fragmentation of an environment as one of (online) spatial clustering. Taking inspiration from the notion of a ``contiguous region'' in robotics, we develop a theory in which fragmentation decisions are driven by surprisal. When this criterion is implemented with boundary, grid, and place cells in various environments, it produces map fragmentations from the first exploration of each space. Augmented with a long-term spatial memory and a rule similar to the distance-dependent Chinese Restaurant Process for selecting among relevant memories, the theory predicts the reuse of map fragments in environments with repeating substructures. Our model provides a simple rule for generating spatial state abstractions and predicts map fragmentations observed in electrophysiological recordings. It further predicts that there should be ``fragmentation decision'' or ``fracture'' cells, which in multicompartment environments could be called ``doorway'' cells.

A demonstration experiment in which recall was examined by what might be called the “method of the missing item” was discussed to point out that a process of searching and testing may reasonably be assumed to intervene between memory and overt response. Two examples were given to illustrate the suggestion that this point of view can be helpful. The first was an experiment on immediate recall of six items presented two at a time, one to one ear and one to the other, at the rate of one item per ear every half-second. Each pair of items that were presented together consisted of a word and a digit, and the side on which the word was presented varied haphazardly from pair to pair. Recall was more successful when S was instructed to report the items of one type and then the items of the other type than when he was instructed to report the items heard on one side and then those heard on the other. The conclusion was that Broadbent's discovery about the preferred order of recall should not be ascribed to an inability to shift attention rapidly from ear to ear; the task is better described as a problem of data-retrieval. The second example was an experiment on an unconventional question that arises when recall is viewed as a search by a data-processor: may items in memory be assumed to carry time-tags that the processor can examine to determine which occurred more recently? The S received a long series of words, alternately seeing new words and judging which of two he had seen more recently. An equal-discriminability scale of recency in a series of concrete nouns was constructed and was compared with a similar scale for a series of abstract words.",

Previous studies have reported cells across visual cortex that are modulated by segmentation features, but the functional role of these cells remains unclear. First, it is unclear whether these cells encode segmentation consistently since most studies used only a limited variety of stimulus types. Second, it is unclear whether these cells are organized into specialized modules or instead randomly scattered across the visual cortex: the former would lend credence to a functional role for putative segmentation cells. Here, we used fMRI-guided electrophysiology to systematically characterize the consistency and spatial organization of segmentation-encoding cells across the visual cortex. Using fMRI, we identified a set of patches in V2, V3, V3A, V4, and V4A that were more active for stimuli containing figures compared to ground, regardless of whether figures were defined by texture, motion, luminance, or disparity. We targeted these patches for single-unit recordings and found that cells inside segmentation patches were tuned to both figure-ground and borders more consistently across types of stimuli than cells in the visual cortex outside the patches. Remarkably, we found clusters of cells inside segmentation patches that showed the same border-ownership preference across all stimulus types. Finally, using a population decoding approach, we found that segmentation could be decoded with higher accuracy from segmentation patches than from either color-selective or control regions. Overall, our results suggest that segmentation signals are preferentially encoded in spatially discrete patches.",

It has been hypothesized that such flexible inferences are aided by simulations of internal models of the external world. However, evidence supporting this hypothesis has been based on behavioral models that do not emulate neural computations. Here, we test this hypothesis by directly comparing the behavior of humans and monkeys in a ball interception task to that of recurrent neural network (RNN) models with or without the capacity to “simulate” the underlying latent variables. Humans and monkeys had strikingly similar behavioral patterns suggesting common underlying neural computations. Comparison between primates and a large class of RNNs revealed that only RNNs that were optimized to simulate the position of the ball were able to accurately capture key features of the behavior such as systematic biases in the inference process. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that primates use mental simulation to make flexible inferences. Moreover, our work highlights a general strategy for using model neural systems to test computational hypotheses of higher brain function. \#\#\# Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest.",

Although artificial agents extract reusable skills from past experience and recombine them in a hierarchical manner, whether the brain similarly composes a novel behavior is largely unknown. In the present study, I show that deep reinforcement learning agents learn to solve a novel composite task by additively combining representations of prelearned action values of constituent subtasks. Learning efficacy in the composite task was further augmented by the introduction of stochasticity in behavior during pretraining. These theoretical predictions were empirically tested in mice, where subtask pretraining enhanced learning of the composite task. Cortex-wide, two-photon calcium imaging revealed analogous neural representations of combined action values, with improved learning when the behavior variability was amplified. Together, these results suggest that the brain composes a novel behavior with a simple arithmetic operation of preacquired action-value representations with stochastic policies.",

This manifold perspective enables blind discovery and decoding of the represented variable using only neural population activity (without knowledge of the input, output, behavior or topography). We characterize and directly visualize manifold structure in the mammalian head direction circuit, revealing that the states form a topologically nontrivial one-dimensional ring. The ring exhibits isometry and is invariant across waking and rapid eye movement sleep.

Here, we seek to bridge this divide by using a ``penalty shot'' task in which pairs of monkeys competed against each other in a competitive, real-time video game. We modeled monkeys' strategies as driven by stochastically evolving goals, onscreen positions that served as set points for a control model that produced observed joystick movements. We fit this goal-based dynamical system model using approximate Bayesian inference methods, using neural networks to parameterize players' goals as a dynamic mixture of Gaussian components. Our model is conceptually simple, constructed of interpretable components, and capable of generating synthetic data that capture the complexity of real player dynamics. We further characterized players' strategies using the number of change points on each trial. We found that this complexity varied more across sessions than within sessions, and that more complex strategies benefited offensive players but not defensive players.

We found that higher-scoring participants timed their final change in direction to moments when the opponent's counter-strategy was weaker, while lower-scoring participants less precisely timed their final moves.

Conversely, decision theories make the simplifying assumption that the relevant information is given, and do not attempt to describe how the decision maker may learn and implement active sampling policies. In this paper I review recent studies that address questions of attentional learning, cue validity and information seeking in humans and non-human primates. These studies suggest that learning a sampling policy involves large scale interactions between networks of attention and valuation, which implement these policies based on reward maximization, uncertainty reduction and the intrinsic utility of cognitive states. I discuss the importance of using such paradigms for formalizing the role of attention, as well as devising more realistic theories of decision making that capture a broader range of empirical observations.",

The core of our proposal is to define deterministic beliefsystem dynamics based on an assumption that the maximum likelihood observation (calculated just prior to the observation) is always obtained. The stochastic effects of future observations are modelled as Gaussian noise. Given this model of the dynamics, two planning and control methods are applied. In the first, linear quadratic regulation (LQR) is applied to generate policies in the belief space. This approach is shown to be optimal for linear- Gaussian systems. In the second, a planner is used to find locally optimal plans in the belief space. We propose a replanning approach that is shown to converge to the belief space goal in a finite number of replanning steps. These approaches are characterized in the context of a simple nonlinear manipulation problem where a planar robot simultaneously locates and grasps an object.",

But precisely because of this, POMDP is notorious for its high computational complexity and deemed impractical for robotics. However, since early 2000, POMDPs solving capabilities have advanced tremendously, thanks to sampling-based approximate solvers. Although these solvers do not generate the optimal solution, they can compute good POMDP solutions that significantly improve the robustness of robotics systems within reasonable computational resources, thereby making POMDPs practical for many realistic robotics problems.

Methods Four manual dexterity tests have been executed by the monkeys, over several weeks during learning and stable performance phases (in controlled body position): the modified Brinkman board, the reach and grasp drawer, the tube and the bimanual board tasks. Three behavioral tests, adapted versions from the monkeys tasks (modified Brinkman board, tube and bimanual board tasks), as well as a handedness questionnaire, have been conducted in human subjects. Results In monkeys, there was a large disparity across individuals and motor tasks. For hand dominance, two monkeys were rather right lateralized, three monkeys rather left lateralized, whereas in three monkeys, the different parameters measured were not consistent. For hand preference, none of the eight monkeys exhibited a homogeneous lateralization across the four motor tasks. Macaca fascicularis do not exhibit a clear hand preference. Furthermore, hand preference often changed with task repetition, both during training and plateau phases. For human subjects, the hand preference mostly followed the self-assessment of lateralization by the subjects and the questionnaire (in the latter, right-handers were more lateralized than left-handers), except a few discrepancies based on the tube task. There was no hand dominance in seven right-handers (the other three performed better with the right hand) and in four left-handers. Five left-handers showed left-hand dominance, whereas surprisingly, one left-hander performed better with the right hand. In the modified Brinkman board task, females performed better than males, right-handers better than left-handers. Conclusions The present study argues for a distinction between hand preference and hand dominance, especially in macaque monkeys.",

Grasp force was strongly encoded by neural populations of all three areas, thereby demonstrating for the first time the coding of grasp force in single- and multi-units of AIP. Neural coding of intended grasp force was most strongly represented in area F5. In addition to tuning analysis, a dimensionality reduction method revealed low-dimensional responses to grip type and grip force. Additionally, this method revealed a high correlation between latent variables of the neural population representing grasp force and the corresponding latent variables of electromyographic forearm muscle activity.

For example, through experience, we become proficient at manipulating a large range of objects with distinct dynamical properties. However, it is unknown what principle underlies how our continuous stream of sensorimotor experience is segmented into separate memories and how we adapt and use this growing repertoire. Here we develop a theory of motor learning based on the key principle that memory creation, updating and expression are all controlled by a single computation-contextual inference. Our theory reveals that adaptation can arise both by creating and updating memories (proper learning) and by changing how existing memories are differentially expressed (apparent learning). This insight enables us to account for key features of motor learning that had no unified explanation: spontaneous recovery1, savings2, anterograde interference3, how environmental consistency affects learning rate4,5 and the distinction between explicit and implicit learning6. Critically, our theory also predicts new phenomena-evoked recovery and context-dependent single-trial learning-which we confirm experimentally.

To examine information seeking and use in a known problem structure, we trained monkeys in an explore/exploit task, requiring the animal first to test objects for their association with reward, then, once rewarded objects were found, to re-select them on further trials for further rewards. Many cells in the frontal cortex showed an explore/exploit preference aligned with the one-shot learning in the monkeys' behavior: the population switched from an explore state to an exploit state after a single trial of learning, but partially maintained the explore state if an error indicated that learning had failed. Binary switch from explore to exploit was not explained by continuous changes linked to expectancy or prediction error. Explore/exploit preferences were independent for two stages of the trial, object selection and receipt of feedback.

We approach these questions about the living using concepts and tools from machine learning and developmental robotics. We argue that curiosity-driven learning enables organisms to make discoveries to solve complex problems with rare or deceptive rewards. By fostering exploration and discovery of a diversity of behavioural skills, and ignoring these rewards, curiosity can be efficient to bootstrap learning when there is no information, or deceptive information, about local improvement towards these problems. We also explain the key role of curiosity for efficient learning of world models. We review both normative and heuristic computational frameworks used to understand the mechanisms of curiosity in humans, conceptualizing the child as a sense-making organism. These frameworks enable us to discuss the bi-directional causal links between curiosity and learning, and to provide new hypotheses about the fundamental role of curiosity in self-organizing developmental structures through curriculum learning. We present various developmental robotics experiments that study these mechanisms in action, both supporting these hypotheses to understand better curiosity in humans and opening new research avenues in machine learning and artificial intelligence.

In this perspectives article, we posit that self-tuition is an evolved principle of vertebrate brain design that is reflected in its basic architecture and critical for its normal development. Self-tuition involves coordination between functionally distinct components of the brain, with one set of areas motivating exploration that leads to the experiences that train another set. We review key hypothalamic and telencephalic structures involved in this interplay, including their anatomical connections and placement within the segmental architecture of conserved forebrain circuits. We discuss the nature of educative behaviours motivated by the hypothalamus, innate stimulus biases, the relationship to survival in early life, and mechanisms by which telencephalic areas gradually accumulate knowledge. We argue that this aspect of brain function is of paramount importance for systems neuroscience, as it confers neural specialization and allows animals to attain far more sophisticated behaviours than would be possible through genetic mechanisms alone. Self-tuition is of particular importance in humans and other primates, whose large brains and complex social cognition rely critically on experience-based learning during a protracted childhood period.

  abstract = "The nervous system is a product of evolution. That is, it was constructed through a long series of modifications, within the strong constraints of heredity, and continuously subjected to intense selection pressures. As a result, the organization and functions of the brain are shaped by its history. We believe that this fact, underappreciated in contemporary systems neuroscience, offers an invaluable aid for helping us resolve the brain's mysteries. Indeed, we think that the consideration of evolutionary history ought to take its place alongside other intellectual tools used to understand the brain, such as behavioural experiments, studies of anatomical structure and functional characterization based on recordings of neural activity. In this introduction, we argue for the importance of evolution by highlighting specific examples of ways that evolutionary theory can enhance neuroscience. The rest of the theme issue elaborates this point, emphasizing the conservative nature of neural evolution, the important consequences of specific transitions that occurred in our history, and the ways in which considerations of evolution can shed light on issues ranging from specific mechanisms to fundamental principles of brain organization.

I begin with basic feedback mechanisms of ancient mobile animals and follow the major niche transitions from aquatic to terrestrial life, the retreat into nocturnality in early mammals, the transition to arboreal life and the return to diurnality. Along the way, I propose a sequence of elaboration and diversification of the behavioural repertoire and associated neuroanatomical substrates. This includes midbrain control of approach versus escape actions, telencephalic control of local versus long-range foraging, detection of affordances by the dorsal pallium, diversified control of nocturnal foraging in the mammalian neocortex and expansion of primate frontal, temporal and parietal cortex to support a wide variety of primate-specific behavioural strategies. The result is a proposed functional architecture consisting of parallel control systems, each dedicated to specifying the affordances for guiding particular species-typical actions, which compete against each other through a hierarchy of selection mechanisms.

Second, we assessed the extent to which responses to different stimuli occupy similar dimensions of the population activity space using a novel statistical method. For comparison, we performed the same dimensionality reduction analyses on the activity of a recently-proposed V1 receptive field model and a deep convolutional neural network.

Commonly used methods to extract these latent variables typically assume instantaneous relationships between the latent and observed variables. In many physical systems, changes in the latent variables manifest as changes in the observed variables after time delays. Techniques that do not account for these delays can recover a larger number of latent variables than are present in the system, thereby making the latent representation more difficult to interpret. In this work, we introduce a novel probabilistic technique, time-delay gaussian-process factor analysis (TD-GPFA), that performs dimensionality reduction in the presence of a different time delay between each pair of latent and observed variables. We demonstrate how using a gaussian process to model the evolution of each latent variable allows us to tractably learn these delays over a continuous domain. Additionally, we show how TD-GPFA combines temporal smoothing and dimensionality reduction into a common probabilistic framework. We present an expectation/conditional maximization either (ECME) algorithm to learn the model parameters. Our simulations demonstrate that when time delays are present, TD-GPFA is able to correctly identify these delays and recover the latent space. We then applied TD-GPFA to the activity of tens of neurons recorded simultaneously in the macaque motor cortex during a reaching task. TD-GPFA is able to better describe the neural activity using a more parsimonious latent space than GPFA, a method that has been used to interpret motor cortex data but does not account for time delays. More broadly, TD-GPFA can help to unravel the mechanisms underlying high-dimensional time series data by taking into account physical delays in the system.",

We show that the neurons encode, before the saccade, the information gain (reduction in decision uncertainty) that the saccade was expected to bring for the following action. Sensitivity to information gain correlates with the monkeys' efficiency at processing the information in the post-saccadic fixation, but is independent of neuronal reward sensitivity. Reward sensitivity, in turn, is unreliable across task contexts, inconsistent with the view that the cells encode economic utility. The findings suggest that parietal cells involved in oculomotor decisions show uncertainty-dependent boosts of neural gain that facilitate the implementation of active sampling policies, including the selection of relevant cues and the efficient use of the information delivered by these cues.",

Here we investigate this question by leveraging simultaneous neuronal population recordings in early and midlevel visual areas (V1-V2 and V1-V4). Using a dimensionality reduction approach, we find that population interactions are feedforward-dominated shortly after stimulus onset and feedback-dominated during spontaneous activity. The population activity patterns most correlated across areas were distinct during feedforward- and feedback-dominated periods. These results suggest that feedforward and feedback signaling rely on separate “channels”, such that feedback signaling does not directly affect activity that is fed forward. \#\#\# Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest.",

Neural population activity from visual area V4, as well as from prefrontal cortex, slowly drifted together with these behavioral fluctuations. We found that this slow drift, rather than altering the encoding of the sensory stimulus, acted as an impulsivity signal, overriding sensory evidence to dictate the final decision.

How do humans identify useful sources of knowledge and decide which learning situations to approach in the absence of external rewards? While the recognition of this important problem has grown in psychological sciences over the recent years, an intriguing proposition for the possible mechanism comes from artificial intelligence, where efficient autonomous learning is achieved by programming agents to follow the heuristic of maximizing learning progress (LP) during exploration. In this study, we set out to examine the empirical evidence for this idea. Using computational modeling, we demonstrate that humans show signs of following LP while they freely explore and practice a set of multiple learning activities of varying difficulty, including an activity that is impossible to learn. Different approaches to operationalizing the notion of LP and their plausibility in light of empirical data are also discussed. We also show that models combining several types of intrinsic rewards fit better human exploration data than single component models considered so far in theoretical accounts.",

We propose a novel CAM architecture, Memory Scaffold with Heteroassociation (MESH), that factorizes the problems of internal attractor dynamics and association with external content to generate a CAM continuum without a memory cliff: Small numbers of patterns are stored with complete information recovery matching standard CAMs, while inserting more patterns still results in partial recall of every pattern, with a graceful trade-off between pattern number and pattern richness. Motivated by the architecture of the Entorhinal-Hippocampal memory circuit in the brain, MESH is a tripartite architecture with pairwise interactions that uses a predetermined set of internally stabilized states together with heteroassociation between the internal states and arbitrary external patterns. We show analytically and experimentally that for any number of stored patterns, MESH nearly saturates the total information bound (given by the number of synapses) for CAM networks, outperforming all existing CAM models.",

Here we show that despite complex and heterogeneous temporal dynamics in single-neuron activity, PFC activity is endowed with a population-level coding of the mnemonic stimulus that is stable and robust throughout WM maintenance. We applied population-level analyses to hundreds of recorded single neurons from lateral PFC of monkeys performing two seminal tasks that demand parametric WM: oculomotor delayed response and vibrotactile delayed discrimination. We found that the high-dimensional state space of PFC population activity contains a low-dimensional subspace in which stimulus representations are stable across time during the cue and delay epochs, enabling robust and generalizable decoding compared with time-optimized subspaces. To explore potential mechanisms, we applied these same population-level analyses to theoretical neural circuit models of WM activity. Three previously proposed models failed to capture the key population-level features observed empirically. We propose network connectivity properties, implemented in a linear network model, which can underlie these features. This work uncovers stable population-level WM representations in PFC, despite strong temporal neural dynamics, thereby providing insights into neural circuit mechanisms supporting WM.",

It is shown that the stochastic background activity, of 1-5 spikes/s, is unstable if all neurons are excitatory. On the other hand, spontaneous activity becomes self-stabilizing in presence of local inhibition, given reasonable values of the parameters of the network. Second, in a network sustaining physiological spontaneous rates, we study the effect of learning in a local module, expressed in synaptic modifications in specific populations of synapses. We find that if the average synaptic potentiation (LTP) is too low, no stimulus specific activity manifests itself in the delay period. Instead, following the presentation and removal of any stimulus there is, in the local module, a delay activity in which all neurons selective (responding visually) to any of the stimuli presented for learning have rates which gradually increase with the amplitude of synaptic potentiation. When the average LTP increases beyond a critical value, specific local attractors (stable states) appear abruptly against the background of the global uniform spontaneous attractor. In this case the local module has two available types of collective delay activity: if the stimulus is unfamiliar, the activity is spontaneous; if it is similar to a learned stimulus, delay activity is selective. These new attractors reflect the synaptic structure developed during learning. In each of them a small population of neurons have elevated rates, which depend on the strength of LTP. The remaining neurons of the module have their activity at spontaneous rates. The predictions made in this paper could be checked by single unit recordings in delayed response experiments.",

We studied population activity structure as a function of neuron type by applying factor analysis to spontaneous activity from spiking networks with balanced excitation and inhibition. Throughout the study, we characterized population activity structure by measuring its dimensionality and the percentage of overall activity variance that is shared among neurons. First, by sampling only excitatory or only inhibitory neurons, we found that the activity structures of these two populations in balanced networks are measurably different. We also found that the population activity structure is dependent on the ratio of excitatory to inhibitory neurons sampled. Finally we classified neurons from extracellular recordings in the primary visual cortex of anesthetized macaques as putative excitatory or inhibitory using waveform classification, and found similarities with the neuron type-specific population activity structure of a balanced network with excitatory clustering. These results imply that knowledge of neuron type is important, and allows for stronger statistical tests, when interpreting population activity structure.",

We address these questions by applying factor analysis to recordings in the visual cortex of non-human primates and to spiking network models that self-generate irregular activity through a balance of excitation and inhibition. We compared the scaling trends of two key outputs of dimensionality reduction-shared dimensionality and percent shared variance-with neuron and trial count. We found that the scaling properties of networks with non-clustered and clustered connectivity differed, and that the in vivo recordings were more consistent with the clustered network. Furthermore, recordings from tens of neurons were sufficient to identify the dominant modes of shared variability that generalize to larger portions of the network. These findings can help guide the interpretation of dimensionality reduction outputs in regimes of limited neuron and trial sampling and help relate these outputs to the underlying network structure.",

Neuropsychological studies and previous split-brain experiments predicted that prefrontal cortex exerts executive control upon inferior temporal cortex in memory retrieval; however, no neuronal correlate of this process has ever been detected. Here we show evidence of the top-down signal from prefrontal cortex. In the absence of bottom-up visual inputs, single inferior temporal neurons were activated by the top-down signal, which conveyed information on semantic categorization imposed by visual stimulus-stimulus association. Behavioural performance was severely impaired with loss of the top-down signal. Control experiments confirmed that the signal was transmitted not through a subcortical but through a fronto-temporal cortical pathway. Thus, feedback projections from prefrontal cortex to the posterior association cortex appear to serve the executive control of voluntary recall.",

  abstract = "Working memory is a crucial component of most cognitive tasks. Its neuronal mechanisms are still unclear despite intensive experimental and theoretical explorations. Most theoretical models of working memory assume both time-invariant neural representations and precise connectivity schemes based on the tuning properties of network neurons. A different, more recent class of models assumes randomly connected neurons that have no tuning to any particular task, and bases task performance purely on adjustment of network readout. Intermediate between these schemes are networks that start out random but are trained by a learning scheme. Experimental studies of a delayed vibrotactile discrimination task indicate that some of the neurons in prefrontal cortex are persistently tuned to the frequency of a remembered stimulus, but the majority exhibit more complex relationships to the stimulus that vary considerably across time. We compare three models, ranging from a highly organized line attractor model to a randomly connected network with chaotic activity, with data recorded during this task. The random network does a surprisingly good job of both performing the task and matching certain aspects of the data. The intermediate model, in which an initially random network is partially trained to perform the working memory task by tuning its recurrent and readout connections, provides a better description, although none of the models matches all features of the data. Our results suggest that prefrontal networks may begin in a random state relative to the task and initially rely on modified readout for task performance. With further training, however, more tuned neurons with less time-varying responses should emerge as the networks become more structured.",

A recent study (Kiani et al., 2008) using brief motion pulses (superimposed on a random moving dot display) reported a primacy effect: pulses presented early in a motion observation period had a stronger impact than pulses presented later. This observation was interpreted as supporting the bounded diffusion (BD) model and ruling out models in which evidence accumulation is subject to leakage or decay of early-arriving information. We use motion pulses and other manipulations of the timing of the perceptual evidence in new experiments and simulations that support the leaky competing accumulator (LCA) model as an alternative to the BD model. While the LCA does include leakage, we show that it can exhibit primacy as a result of competition between alternatives (implemented via mutual inhibition), when the inhibition is strong relative to the leak. Our experiments replicate the primacy effect when participants must be prepared to respond quickly at the end of a motion observation period. With less time pressure, however, the primacy effect is much weaker. For 2 (out of 10) participants, a primacy bias observed in trials where the motion observation period is short becomes weaker or reverses (becoming a recency effect) as the observation period lengthens. Our simulation studies show that primacy is equally consistent with the LCA or with BD. The transition from primacy-to-recency can also be captured by the LCA but not by BD. Individual differences and relations between the LCA and other models are discussed.",

In this work we investigated the extent to which humans use these two strategies. In our ``Horizon task,'' participants made explore-exploit decisions in two contexts that differed in the number of choices that they would make in the future (the time horizon). Participants were allowed to make either a single choice in each game (horizon 1), or 6 sequential choices (horizon 6), giving them more opportunity to explore. By modeling the behavior in these two conditions, we were able to measure exploration-related changes in decision making and quantify the contributions of the two strategies to behavior. We found that participants were more information seeking and had higher decision noise with the longer horizon, suggesting that humans use both strategies to solve the exploration-exploitation dilemma. We thus conclude that both information seeking and choice variability can be controlled and put to use in the service of exploration.",

Initially such work stemmed from psychological investigations of conditioned behavior, and explanations of these in terms of computational models. Increasingly, analysis at the computational level has drawn on ideas from reinforcement learning, which provide a normative framework within which decision-making can be analyzed. More recently, the fruits of these extensive lines of research have made contact with investigations into the neural basis of decision making. Converging evidence now links reinforcement learning to specific neural substrates, assigning them precise computational roles. Specifically, electrophysiological recordings in behaving animals and functional imaging of human decision-making have revealed in the brain the existence of a key reinforcement learning signal, the temporal difference reward prediction error. Here, we first introduce the formal reinforcement learning framework. We then review the multiple lines of evidence linking reinforcement learning to the function of dopaminergic neurons in the mammalian midbrain and to more recent data from human imaging experiments. We further extend the discussion to aspects of learning not associated with phasic dopamine signals, such as learning of goal-directed responding that may not be dopamine-dependent, and learning about the vigor (or rate) with which actions should be performed that has been linked to tonic aspects of dopaminergic signaling. We end with a brief discussion of some of the limitations of the reinforcement learning framework, highlighting questions for future research.",

The main drivers of simulation neuroscience are big data generated at multiple levels of brain organization and the need to integrate these data to trace the causal chain of interactions within and across all these levels. Simulation neuroscience is currently the only methodology for systematically approaching the multiscale brain. In this review, we attempt to reconstruct the deep historical paths leading to simulation neuroscience, from the first observations of the nerve cell to modern efforts to digitally reconstruct and simulate the brain. Neuroscience began with the identification of the neuron as the fundamental unit of brain structure and function and has evolved towards understanding the role of each cell type in the brain, how brain cells are connected to each other, and how the seemingly infinite networks they form give rise to the vast diversity of brain functions. Neuronal mapping is evolving from subjective descriptions of cell types towards objective classes, subclasses and types. Connectivity mapping is evolving from loose topographic maps between brain regions towards dense anatomical and physiological maps of connections between individual genetically distinct neurons. Functional mapping is evolving from psychological and behavioral stereotypes towards a map of behaviors emerging from structural and functional connectomes. We show how industrialization of neuroscience and the resulting large disconnected datasets are generating demand for integrative neuroscience, how the scale of neuronal and connectivity maps is driving digital atlasing and digital reconstruction to piece together the multiple levels of brain organization, and how the complexity of the interactions between molecules, neurons, microcircuits and brain regions is driving brain simulation to understand the interactions in the multiscale brain.",

This issue is particularly important because a tendency to sample less information (often known as reflection impulsivity) is a feature in several psychopathologies, such as psychosis. A formal understanding of information sampling may therefore clarify the computational anatomy of psychopathology. In this theoretical letter, we consider evidence accumulation in terms of active (Bayesian) inference using a generic model of Markov decision processes. Here, agents are equipped with beliefs about their own behavior--in this case, that they will make informed decisions. Normative decision making is then modeled using variational Bayes to minimize surprise about choice outcomes. Under this scheme, different facets of belief updating map naturally onto the functional anatomy of the brain (at least at a heuristic level). Of particular interest is the key role played by the expected precision of beliefs about control, which we have previously suggested may be encoded by dopaminergic neurons in the midbrain. We show that manipulating expected precision strongly affects how much information an agent characteristically samples, and thus provides a possible link between impulsivity and dopaminergic dysfunction. Our study therefore represents a step toward understanding evidence accumulation in terms of neurobiologically plausible Bayesian inference and may cast light on why this process is disordered in psychopathology.",

First, we present analyses that make it possible to measure reward-credit assignment--a crucial component of reward-value learning--independently of the decisions animals make.

  abstract = "Summary In uncertain environments, seeking information about alternative choice options is essential for adaptive learning and decision-making. However, information seeking is usually confounded with changes-of-mind about the reliability of the preferred option. Here, we exploited the fact that information seeking requires control over which option to sample to isolate its behavioral and neurophysiological signatures. We found that changes-of-mind occurring with control require more evidence against the current option, are associated with reduced confidence, but are nevertheless more likely to be confirmed on the next decision. Multimodal neurophysiological recordings showed that these changes-of-mind are preceded by stronger activation of the dorsal attention network in magnetoencephalography (MEG), and followed by increased pupil-linked arousal during the presentation of decision outcomes. Together, these findings indicate that information seeking increases the saliency of evidence perceived as the direct consequence of one’s own actions.Highlights Exploration-exploitation dilemmas confound information seeking with changes-of-mind.Unlike changes-of-mind, information seeking requires control over information sampling.Information seeking is associated with reduced confidence and active hypothesis testing.Stronger neurophysiological correlates of attention and arousal during information seeking.",

Damage to these areas produces a deficit in the maintenance of pursuit eye movements when the target towards the side of the brain with the lesion. In the present experiments, we electrically stimulated these areas to better localize and understand the mechanisms underlying this directional pursuit deficit. 2. Monkeys were trained to pursue a moving target using a step-ramp task in which the target first stepped to an eccentric position and then moved smoothly across the screen. Trains of stimulation were applied after the monkey had begun to pursue the target to study stimulation effects of maintenance of pursuit. 3. Stimulation during pursuit frequently produced eye acceleration toward the side of the brain stimulated. Eye speed increased during pursuit toward the side stimulated and decreased during pursuit away from the side stimulated. This increase in velocity toward the side of the brain where stimulation presumably activated cells is consistent with the decrease in pursuit velocity toward the side of the brain after cells were removed by chemical lesions. 4. The increase or decrease in pursuit speed following stimulation produced a slip of the target on the retina. The pursuit system seemed to be insensitive to this slip during the period of stimulation, however, since the effect of stimulation during pursuit of a stabilized image (open-loop condition) was similar to that resulting from stimulation under normal pursuit conditions (closed-loop). This insensitivity to visual motion during stimulation suggests that the stimulation substitutes for that visual input. 5. The separation of eye and target position that resulted from stimulation did produce catch-up saccades. This provides added evidence that alteration of middle temporal area (MT) and medial superior temporal area (MST) modifies visual-motion but not visual-position information. 6. Stimulation that produced eye acceleration during pursuit produced only a slight effect during fixation of a stationary target. The effectiveness of the stimulation also increased as the speed of the pursuit increased between 5 and 25 degrees/s. These observations, which show that pursuit velocity altered the effect of stimulation, suggest that the stimulation acted on visual motion processing before information about the pursuit movement itself is incorporated. Since this stimulation produces directional pursuit effects, we hypothesize that the directional bias for pursuit originates in the visual signal conveyed to the pursuit system.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

When a new piece of information is witnessed, activity levels reflect its salience for predicting future outcomes.

We show that habits emerge naturally (and autodidactically) from sequential policy optimisation when agents are equipped with state-action policies. In active inference, behaviour has explorative (epistemic) and exploitative (pragmatic) aspects that are sensitive to ambiguity and risk respectively, where epistemic (ambiguity-resolving) behaviour enables pragmatic (reward-seeking) behaviour and the subsequent emergence of habits. Although goal-directed and habitual policies are usually associated with model-based and model-free schemes, we find the more important distinction is between belief-free and belief-based schemes. The underlying (variational) belief updating provides a comprehensive (if metaphorical) process theory for several phenomena, including the transfer of dopamine responses, reversal learning, habit formation and devaluation. Finally, we show that active inference reduces to a classical (Bellman) scheme, in the absence of ambiguity.",

  abstract = "Reinforcement learning (RL) refers to the behavioral process of learning to obtain reward and avoid punishment. An important component of RL is managing explore-exploit tradeoffs, which refers to the problem of choosing between exploiting options with known values and exploring unfamiliar options. We examined correlates of this tradeoff, as well as other RL related variables, in orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) while three male monkeys performed a three-armed bandit learning task. During the task, novel choice options periodically replaced familiar options. The values of the novel options were unknown, and the monkeys had to explore them to see if they were better than other currently available options. The identity of the chosen stimulus and the reward outcome were strongly encoded in the responses of single OFC neurons. These two variables define the states and state transitions in our model that are relevant to decision-making. The chosen value of the option and the relative value of exploring that option were encoded at intermediate levels. We also found that OFC value coding was stimulus specific, as opposed to coding value independent of the identity of the option. The location of the option and the value of the current environment were encoded at low levels. Therefore, we found encoding of the variables relevant to learning and managing explore-exploit tradeoffs in OFC. These results are consistent with findings in the ventral striatum and amygdala and show that this monosynaptically connected network plays an important role in learning based on the immediate and future consequences of choices.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) has been implicated in representing the expected values of choices. Here we extend these results and show that OFC also encodes information relevant to managing explore-exploit tradeoffs. Specifically, OFC encodes an exploration bonus, which characterizes the relative value of exploring novel choice options. OFC also strongly encodes the identity of the chosen stimulus, and reward outcomes, which are necessary for computing the value of novel and familiar options.",

It is argued that theoretical accounts of curiosity proposed during the 1st period fell short in 2 areas: They did not offer an adequate explanation for why people voluntarily seek out curiosity, and they failed to delineate situational determinants of curiosity. Furthermore, these accounts did not draw attention to, and thus did not explain, certain salient characteristics of curiosity: its intensity, transience, association with impulsivity, and tendency to disappoint when satisfied. A new account of curiosity is offered that attempts to address these shortcomings. The new account interprets curiosity as a form of cognitively induced deprivation that arises from the perception of a gap in knowledge or understanding.

To test this, we recorded from neurons in the lateral habenula, a nucleus that encodes RPEs, while monkeys chose between cues that provided different chances to view information about upcoming rewards. We found that a subpopulation of lateral habenula neurons transmitted signals resembling IPEs, responding when reward information was unexpectedly cued, delivered or denied.

Previous neuroimaging and neurophysiological studies have implicated orbitofrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, and ventral striatum in distinguishing between bouts of exploration and exploitation. Nonetheless, the neuronal mechanisms that underlie strategy selection remain poorly understood. We hypothesized that posterior cingulate cortex (CGp), an area linking reward processing, attention, memory, and motor control systems, mediates the integration of variables such as reward, uncertainty, and target location that underlie this dynamic balance. Here we show that CGp neurons distinguish between exploratory and exploitative decisions made by monkeys in a dynamic foraging task. Moreover, firing rates of these neurons predict in graded fashion the strategy most likely to be selected on upcoming trials. This encoding is distinct from switching between targets and is independent of the absolute magnitudes of rewards. These observations implicate CGp in the integration of individual outcomes across decision making and the modification of strategy in dynamic environments.",

Conceptually, the decision to take or decline an option is related to threshold crossing in drift diffusion models, when this process is thought of as a value comparison. We studied this task in healthy volunteers using fMRI, and used a Markov decision process to quantify the value of continuing to search versus committing to the current option. Decisions to take versus decline an option engaged parietal and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices, as well ventral striatum, anterior insula, and anterior cingulate.

This aspect of behaviour is not captured well by classical theories of decision making, and the cognitive mechanisms of information seeking are poorly understood. In particular, it is not known whether information is valued only for its instrumental use, or whether humans also assign it a non-instrumental intrinsic value. To address this question, the present study assessed preference for non-instrumental information among 80 healthy participants in two experiments. Participants performed a novel information preference task in which they could choose to pay a monetary cost to receive advance information about the outcome of a monetary lottery. Importantly, acquiring information did not alter lottery outcome probabilities. We found that participants were willing to incur considerable monetary costs to acquire payoff-irrelevant information about the lottery outcome. This behaviour was well explained by a computational cognitive model in which information preference resulted from aversion to temporally prolonged uncertainty. These results strongly suggest that humans assign an intrinsic value to information in a manner inconsistent with normative accounts of decision making under uncertainty. This intrinsic value may be associated with adaptive behaviour in real-world environments by producing a bias towards exploratory and information-seeking behaviour.",

Also, when faced with urns that had bead color splits closer to chance (60/40 versus 80/20) or potential monetary losses, participants increased their evidence seeking, but they showed less increase than predicted by the ideal observer model. Functional magnetic resonance imaging showed that urn choices evoked larger hemodynamic responses than draw choices in the insula, striatum, anterior cingulate, and parietal cortex.

The target's center coincided with the mean of a circular Gaussian distribution from which participants could sample repeatedly. Each ``cue'' - sampled one at a time - was plotted as a dot on the display. Participants had to repeatedly decide, after sampling each cue, whether to stop sampling and attempt to touch the hidden target or continue sampling. Each additional cue increased the participants' probability of successfully touching the hidden target but reduced their potential reward. Two experimental conditions differed in the initial reward associated with touching the hidden target and the fixed cost per cue. For each condition we computed the optimal number of cues that participants should sample, before taking action, to maximize expected gain. Contrary to recent claims that people gather less information than they objectively should before taking action, we found that participants over-sampled in one experimental condition, and did not significantly under- or over-sample in the other. Additionally, while the ideal observer model ignores the current sample dispersion, we found that participants used it to decide whether to stop sampling and take action or continue sampling, a possible consequence of imperfect learning of the underlying population dispersion across trials.",

Specifically, we discuss the important role of acetylcholine in governing mechanisms of active maintenance in working memory tasks and in regulating network dynamics important for effective processing of stimuli in attention and episodic memory tasks. We also propose that theta rhythm plays a crucial role as an intermediary between the physiological influences of acetylcholine and behavior in episodic and spatial memory tasks. We conclude with a synthesis of the existing modeling work and highlight future directions that are likely to be rewarding given the existing state of the literature for both empiricists and modelers.",

We find that dACC carries two sets of signals, (1) world-centric variables that together form a representation of the position and velocity of all relevant agents (self, prey, and predator) in the virtual world, and (2) avatar-centric variables, i.e. self-prey distance and angle. Both sets of variables are multiplexed within an overlapping set of neurons.

  abstract = "AbstractForming an episodic memory requires binding together disparate elements that co-occur in a single experience. One model of this process is that neurons representing different components of a memory bind to an “index” — a subset of neurons unique to that memory. Evidence for this model has recently been found in chickadees, which use hippocampal memory to store and recall locations of cached food. Chickadee hippocampus produces sparse, high-dimensional patterns (“barcodes”) that uniquely specify each caching event. Unexpectedly, the same neurons that participate in barcodes also exhibit conventional place tuning. It is unknown how barcode activity is generated, and what role it plays in memory formation and retrieval. It is also unclear how a memory index (e.g. barcodes) could function in the same neural population that represents memory content (e.g. place). Here, we design a biologically plausible model that generates barcodes and uses them to bind experiential content. Our model generates barcodes from place inputs through the chaotic dynamics of a recurrent neural network and uses Hebbian plasticity to store barcodes as attractor states. The model matches experimental observations that memory indices (barcodes) and content signals (place tuning) are randomly intermixed in the activity of single neurons. We demonstrate that barcodes reduce memory interference between correlated experiences. We also show that place tuning plays a complementary role to barcodes, enabling flexible, contextually-appropriate memory retrieval. Finally, our model is compatible with previous models of the hippocampus as generating a predictive map. Distinct predictive and indexing functions of the network are achieved via an adjustment of global recurrent gain. Our results suggest how the hippocampus may use barcodes to resolve fundamental tensions between memory specificity (pattern separation) and flexible recall (pattern completion) in general memory systems.",

Surprisingly, experiments show that most of this flux in connectivity persists in the absence of learning or known plasticity signals. How can neural circuits retain learned information despite a large proportion of ongoing and potentially disruptive synaptic changes? We address this question from first principles by analysing how much compensatory plasticity would be required to optimally counteract ongoing fluctuations, regardless of whether fluctuations are random or systematic. Remarkably, we find that the answer is largely independent of plasticity mechanisms and circuit architectures: compensatory plasticity should be at most equal in magnitude to fluctuations, and often less, in direct agreement with previously unexplained experimental observations. Moreover, our analysis shows that a high proportion of learning-independent synaptic change is consistent with plasticity mechanisms that accurately compute error gradients.",

The prevailing view in Neuroscience attributes changes in synaptic efficacy to memory acquisition, implying that stable memories correspond to stable connectivity patterns. However, an increasing body of experimental evidence points to significant, activity-independent fluctuations in synaptic strengths. How memories can survive these fluctuations and the accompanying stabilizing homeostatic mechanisms is a fundamental open question. Here we explore the possibility of memory storage within a global component of network connectivity, while individual connections fluctuate. We find that homeostatic stabilization of fluctuations differentially affects different aspects of network connectivity. Specifically, memories stored as time-varying attractors of neural dynamics are more resilient to erosion than fixed-points. Such dynamic attractors can be learned by biologically plausible learning-rules and support associative retrieval. Our results suggest a link between the properties of learning-rules and those of network-level memory representations, and point at experimentally measurable signatures.",

Such ``representational drift'' raises the question of how malleable population codes can interact coherently with stable long-term representations that are found in other circuits and with relatively rigid topographic mappings of peripheral sensory and motor signals. We explore how known plasticity mechanisms can allow single neurons to reliably read out an evolving population code without external error feedback. We find that interactions between Hebbian learning and single-cell homeostasis can exploit redundancy in a distributed population code to compensate for gradual changes in tuning. Recurrent feedback of partially stabilized readouts could allow a pool of readout cells to further correct inconsistencies introduced by representational drift. This shows how relatively simple, known mechanisms can stabilize neural tuning in the short term and provides a plausible explanation for how plastic neural codes remain integrated with consolidated, long-term representations.",

Here we propose a contrasting memory model with complete temporal remodeling of assemblies, based on experimentally observed changes of synapses and neural representations. The assemblies drift freely as noisy autonomous network activity and spontaneous synaptic turnover induce neuron exchange. The gradual exchange allows activity-dependent and homeostatic plasticity to conserve the representational structure and keep inputs, outputs, and assemblies consistent. This leads to persistent memory. Our findings explain recent experimental results on temporal evolution of fear memory representations and suggest that memory systems need to be understood in their completeness as individual parts may constantly change.",

Do you marry your current partner, or try your luck with someone else? The balance required in these situations is commonly referred to as the exploration–exploitation tradeoff. It features prominently in a wide range of research traditions, including learning, foraging, and decision making literatures. Here, we integrate findings from these and other often-isolated literatures in order to gain a better understanding of the possible tradeoffs between exploration and exploitation, and we propose new theoretical insights that might guide future research. Specifically, we explore how potential tradeoffs depend on (a) the conceptualization of exploration and exploitation; (b) the influencing environmental, social, and individual factors; (c) the scale at which exploration and exploitation are considered; (d) the relationship and types of transitions between the 2 behaviors; and (e) the goals of the decision maker. We conclude that exploration and exploitation are best conceptualized as points on a continuum, and that the extent to which an agent’s behavior can be interpreted as exploratory or exploitative depends upon the level of abstraction at which it is considered.

These neuronal object values satisfy principles of competitive choice mechanisms, track performance fluctuations and follow predictions of a classical behavioural model (Herrnstein's matching law). Individual neurons dynamically encode both, the updating of object values from recently experienced rewards, and their subsequent conversion to object choices during decision-making. Decoding from unselected populations enables a read-out of motivational and decision variables not emphasized by individual neurons.

A seemingly distinct challenge is that, cognitively, theories of RL have largely involved procedural and semantic memory, the way in which knowledge about action values or world models extracted gradually from many experiences can drive choice. This focus on semantic memory leaves out many aspects of memory, such as episodic memory, related to the traces of individual events. We suggest that these two challenges are related. The computational challenge can be dealt with, in part, by endowing RL systems with episodic memory, allowing them to (a) efficiently approximate value functions over complex state spaces, (b) learn with very little data, and (c) bridge long-term dependencies between actions and rewards. We review the computational theory underlying this proposal and the empirical evidence to support it.

Accordingly, to examine possible recognition memory signals in the hippocampus, we recorded the activity of 131 hippocampal neurons in two monkeys performing the VPLT. Eighty-eight neurons (67\%) responded significantly to stimulus presentation relative to the baseline prestimulus period.

To address this question, we recorded neural activity in a prefrontal sensorimotor area while monkeys naturally switched between exploring and exploiting rewarding options. We found that exploration profoundly reduced spatially selective, choice-predictive activity in single neurons and delayed choice-predictive population dynamics. At the same time, reward learning was increased in brain and behavior. These results indicate that exploration is related to sudden disruptions in prefrontal sensorimotor control and rapid, reward-dependent reorganization of control dynamics. This may facilitate discovery through trial and error.",

By contrast, animals' foraging choices arise in the context of sequences of encounters with prey or food. On each encounter, the animal chooses whether to engage or, if the environment is sufficiently rich, to search elsewhere. The cost of foraging is also critical. We demonstrate that humans can alternate between two modes of choice, comparative decision-making and foraging, depending on distinct neural mechanisms in ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) using distinct reference frames; in ACC, choice variables are represented in invariant reference to foraging or searching for alternatives. Whereas vmPFC encodes values of specific well-defined options, ACC encodes the average value of the foraging environment and cost of foraging.",

  abstract = "Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) and Deep Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) have achieved significant success across a wide range of domains, such as game AI, autonomous vehicles, robotics and finance. However, DRL and deep MARL agents are widely known to be sample-inefficient and millions of interactions are usually needed even for relatively simple game settings, thus preventing the wide application in real-industry scenarios. One bottleneck challenge behind is the well-known exploration problem, i.e., how to efficiently explore the unknown environments and collect informative experiences that could benefit the policy learning most. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive survey on existing exploration methods in DRL and deep MARL for the purpose of providing understandings and insights on the critical problems and solutions. We first identify several key challenges to achieve efficient exploration, which most of the exploration methods aim at addressing. Then we provide a systematic survey of existing approaches by classifying them into two major categories: uncertainty-oriented exploration and intrinsic motivation-oriented exploration. The essence of uncertainty-oriented exploration is to leverage the quantification of the epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty to derive efficient exploration. By contrast, intrinsic motivation-oriented exploration methods usually incorporate different reward agnostic information for intrinsic exploration guidance. Beyond the above two main branches, we also conclude other exploration methods which adopt sophisticated techniques but are difficult to be classified into the above two categories. In addition, we provide a comprehensive empirical comparison of exploration methods for DRL on a set of commonly used benchmarks. Finally, we summarize the open problems of exploration in DRL and deep MARL and point out a few future directions.",

Given recent successes of neurally mechanistic models and the surging availability of neural, anatomical, and behavioral data, we believe that now is the time to create integrative benchmarking platforms that incentivize ambitious, unified models.

Here we ask, as deep ANNs have continued to evolve, are they becoming more or less brain-like? ANNs that are most functionally similar to the brain will contain mechanisms that are most like those used by the brain. We therefore developed Brain-Score – a composite of multiple neural and behavioral benchmarks that score any ANN on how similar it is to the brain’s mechanisms for core object recognition – and we deployed it to evaluate a wide range of state-of-the-art deep ANNs. Using this scoring system, we here report that: (1) DenseNet-169, CORnet-S and ResNet-101 are the most brain-like ANNs. There remains considerable variability in neural and behavioral responses that is not predicted by any ANN, suggesting that no ANN model has yet captured all the relevant mechanisms. (3) Extending prior work, we found that gains in ANN ImageNet performance led to gains on Brain-Score. However, correlation weakened at ≥ 70\% top-1 ImageNet performance, suggesting that additional guidance from neuroscience is needed to make further advances in capturing brain mechanisms. (4) We uncovered smaller (i.e. less complex) ANNs that are more brain-like than many of the best-performing ImageNet models, which suggests the opportunity to simplify ANNs to better understand the ventral stream. The scoring system used here is far from complete. However, we propose that evaluating and tracking model-benchmark correspondences through a Brain-Score that is regularly updated with new brain data is an exciting opportunity: experimental benchmarks can be used to guide machine network evolution, and machine networks are mechanistic hypotheses of the brain’s network and thus drive next experiments. To facilitate both of these, we release Brain-Score.org: a platform that hosts the neural and behavioral benchmarks, where ANNs for visual processing can be submitted to receive a Brain-Score and their rank relative to other models, and where new experimental data can be naturally incorporated.",

To further elucidate the role of inhibition in spatial tuning, we iontophoresed bicuculline methiodide (BMI) onto functionally characterized neurons in the dPFC of monkeys performing an oculomotor delayed response task. This GABA(A) blockade revealed that both putative interneurons and pyramidal cells possess significant inhibitory tone in the awake, behaving monkey. In addition, BMI application primarily resulted in the loss of previously extant spatial tuning in both cell types through reduction of both isodirectional and cross-directional inhibition. This tuning loss occurred in both the sensorimotor and mnemonic phases of the task, although the delay activity of prefrontal neurons appeared to be particularly affected. Finally, application of BMI also created significant spatial tuning in a sizable minority of units that were untuned in the control condition. Visual field analysis of such tuning suggests that it is likely caused by the unmasking of normally suppressed spatially tuned excitatory input. These findings provide the first direct evidence of directional inhibitory modulation of pyramidal cell and interneuron firing in both the mnemonic and sensorimotor phases of the working memory process, and they implicate a further role for GABAergic interneurons in the construction of spatial tuning in prefrontal cortex.",

We used cross-correlation analysis and characterized the effective connectivity between neurons in relation to their spatial and temporal response properties. The majority of narrow (<5 msec) cross-correlation peaks indicated common input and were most often observed between pairs of neurons within 0.3 mm of each other. Neurons recorded at these distances represented the full range of spatial locations, suggesting that the entire visual hemifield is represented in modules of corresponding dimensions. Nearby neurons could be activated in any epoch of the behavioral task (stimulus presentation, delay, response). The incidence and strength of cross-correlation, however, was highest among cells sharing similar spatial tuning and similar temporal profiles of activation across task epochs. The dependence of correlated discharge on the functional properties of neurons was observed both when we analyzed firing from the task period as well as from baseline fixation.

To determine the particular contributions of pyramidal cells and interneurons to spatial tuning in dPFC, we examined both individually and in pairs the tuning properties of regular-spiking (RS) and fast-spiking (FS) units that represent putative pyramidal cells and interneurons, respectively. Our main finding is that FS units possess spatially tuned sensory, motor, and delay activity (i. e., ``memory fields'') similar to those found in RS units. Furthermore, when recorded simultaneously at the same site, the majority of neighboring neurons, whether FS or RS, displayed isodirectional tuning, i.e., they shared very similar tuning angles for the sensory and delay phases of the task. As the trial entered the response phase of the task, many FS units shifted their direction of tuning and became cross-directional to adjacent RS units by the end of the trial. These results establish that a large part of inhibition in prefrontal cortex is spatially oriented rather than being untuned and simply regulating the threshold response of pyramidal cell output. Moreover, the isodirectional tuning between adjacent neurons supports a functional microcolumnar organization in dPFC for spatial memory fields similar to that found in other areas of cortex for sensory receptive fields.",

We used an artificial neural network, integrating across these three findings, to simulate human immediate serial recall performance.

While typically task-agnostic in architecture, this method still requires task-specific fine-tuning datasets of thousands or tens of thousands of examples. By contrast, humans can generally perform a new language task from only a few examples or from simple instructions - something which current NLP systems still largely struggle to do. Here we show that scaling up language models greatly improves task-agnostic, few-shot performance, sometimes even reaching competitiveness with prior state-of-the-art fine-tuning approaches. Specifically, we train GPT-3, an autoregressive language model with 175 billion parameters, 10x more than any previous non-sparse language model, and test its performance in the few-shot setting. For all tasks, GPT-3 is applied without any gradient updates or fine-tuning, with tasks and few-shot demonstrations specified purely via text interaction with the model. GPT-3 achieves strong performance on many NLP datasets, including translation, question-answering, and cloze tasks, as well as several tasks that require on-the-fly reasoning or domain adaptation, such as unscrambling words, using a novel word in a sentence, or performing 3-digit arithmetic. At the same time, we also identify some datasets where GPT-3's few-shot learning still struggles, as well as some datasets where GPT-3 faces methodological issues related to training on large web corpora. Finally, we find that GPT-3 can generate samples of news articles which human evaluators have difficulty distinguishing from articles written by humans.

Models' neural fits (``brain score'') and fits to behavioral responses are both strongly correlated with model accuracy on the next-word prediction task (but not other language tasks).

  abstract = "Translating advances in neuroscience into benefits for patients with mental illness presents enormous challenges because it involves both the most complex organ, the brain, and its interaction with a similarly complex environment. Dealing with such complexities demands powerful techniques. Computational psychiatry combines multiple levels and types of computation with multiple types of data in an effort to improve understanding, prediction and treatment of mental illness. Computational psychiatry, broadly defined, encompasses two complementary approaches: data driven and theory driven. Data-driven approaches apply machine-learning methods to high-dimensional data to improve classification of disease, predict treatment outcomes or improve treatment selection. These approaches are generally agnostic as to the underlying mechanisms. Theory-driven approaches, in contrast, use models that instantiate prior knowledge of, or explicit hypotheses about, such mechanisms, possibly at multiple levels of analysis and abstraction. We review recent advances in both approaches, with an emphasis on clinical applications, and highlight the utility of combining them.",

In this pedagogical Primer, we introduce ANNs and demonstrate how they have been fruitfully deployed to study neuroscientific questions. We first discuss basic concepts and methods of ANNs. Then, with a focus on bringing this mathematical framework closer to neurobiology, we detail how to customize the analysis, structure, and learning of ANNs to better address a wide range of challenges in brain research.

Our sensors provide imperfect information about the ball's velocity, so we can only estimate it. Combining information from multiple modalities can reduce the error in this estimate1,2,3,4. On a longer time scale, not all velocities are a priori equally probable, and over the course of a match there will be a probability distribution of velocities. According to bayesian theory5,6, an optimal estimate results from combining information about the distribution of velocities—the prior—with evidence from sensory feedback. As uncertainty increases, when playing in fog or at dusk, the system should increasingly rely on prior knowledge. To use a bayesian strategy, the brain would need to represent the prior distribution and the level of uncertainty in the sensory feedback. Here we control the statistical variations of a new sensorimotor task and manipulate the uncertainty of the sensory feedback. We show that subjects internally represent both the statistical distribution of the task and their sensory uncertainty, combining them in a manner consistent with a performance-optimizing bayesian process4,5. The central nervous system therefore employs probabilistic models during sensorimotor learning.",

Choices among risky prospects exhibit several pervasive effects that are inconsistent with the basic tenets of utility theory. In particular, people underweight outcomes that are merely probable in comparison with outcomes that are obtained with certainty. This tendency, called the certainty effect, contributes to risk aversion in choices involving sure gains and to risk seeking in choices involving sure losses. In addition, people generally discard components that are shared by all prospects under consideration. This tendency, called the isolation effect, leads to inconsistent preferences when the same choice is presented in different forms. An alternative theory of choice is developed, in which value is assigned to gains and losses rather than to final assets and in which probabilities are replaced by decision weights. The value function is normally concave for gains, commonly convex for losses, and is generally steeper for losses than for gains. Decision weights are generally lower than the corresponding probabilities, except in the range of low probabilities. Overweighting of low probabilities may contribute to the attractiveness of both insurance and gambling.]",

Some researchers address this by constraining the hypothesis space through assumptions about what the human mind can and cannot do, while others constrain it through principles of rationality and adaptation. Recent work in economics, psychology, neuroscience, and linguistics has begun to integrate both approaches by augmenting rational models with cognitive constraints, incorporating rational principles into cognitive architectures, and applying optimality principles to understanding neural representations. We identify the rational use of limited resources as a unifying principle underlying these diverse approaches, expressing it in a new cognitive modeling paradigm called resource-rational analysis. The integration of rational principles with realistic cognitive constraints makes resource-rational analysis a promising framework for reverse-engineering cognitive mechanisms and representations. It has already shed new light on the debate about human rationality and can be leveraged to revisit classic questions of cognitive psychology within a principled computational framework. We demonstrate that resource-rational models can reconcile the mind's most impressive cognitive skills with people's ostensive irrationality. Resource-rational analysis also provides a new way to connect psychological theory more deeply with artificial intelligence, economics, neuroscience, and linguistics.",

However, these controllers have limited memory and rely on being able to perceive the complete game screen at each decision point. To address these shortcomings, this article investigates the effects of adding recurrency to a Deep Q-Network (DQN) by replacing the first post-convolutional fully-connected layer with a recurrent LSTM. The resulting \textit{Deep Recurrent Q-Network} (DRQN), although capable of seeing only a single frame at each timestep, successfully integrates information through time and replicates DQN's performance on standard Atari games and partially observed equivalents featuring flickering game screens. Additionally, when trained with partial observations and evaluated with incrementally more complete observations, DRQN's performance scales as a function of observability. Conversely, when trained with full observations and evaluated with partial observations, DRQN's performance degrades less than DQN's. Thus, given the same length of history, recurrency is a viable alternative to stacking a history of frames in the DQN's input layer and while recurrency confers no systematic advantage when learning to play the game, the recurrent net can better adapt at evaluation time if the quality of observations changes.",

Long- and short-term memory could differ in two fundamental ways, with only short-term memory demonstrating (1) temporal decay and (2) chunk capacity limits. Both properties of short-term memory are still controversial but the current literature is rather encouraging regarding the existence of both decay and capacity limits. Working memory has been conceived and defined in three different, slightly discrepant ways: as short-term memory applied to cognitive tasks, as a multi-component system that holds and manipulates information in short-term memory, and as the use of attention to manage short-term memory. Regardless of the definition, there are some measures of memory in the short term that seem routine and do not correlate well with cognitive aptitudes and other measures (those usually identified with the term ``working memory'') that seem more attention demanding and do correlate well with these aptitudes. The evidence is evaluated and placed within a theoretical framework depicted in Fig. 1.",

Removal of the hippocampal formation plus rhinal cortex resulted in a mild recognition deficit, whereas removal of the amygdaloid complex plus rhinal cortex resulted in a severe deficit. Comparison of the results with those of an earlier study (Mishkin, 1978) indicates that adding a rhinal cortical removal to hippocampectomy yields little, if any, additional impairment in recognition. By contrast, adding a rhinal cortical removal to an amygdalectomy has a profound effect; indeed, the recognition impairment in monkeys with amygdaloid plus rhinal removals was at least as severe as that seen in monkeys with combined amygdaloid and hippocampal removals. Taken together, these results support the conclusion that combined damage to the amygdaloid and hippocampal systems is necessary to produce a severe recognition deficit. In addition, they suggest that the effect of ablating the rhinal cortex is equivalent to that of removing the entire hippocampal formation, presumably because the rhinal cortical ablation disconnects the hippocampus from its neocortical input.",

Models that learn via changes to connections help explain this organization. These models discover the structure in ensembles of items if learning of each item is gradual and interleaved with learning about other items. This suggests that the neocortex learns slowly to discover the structure in ensembles of experiences.

We used MRI-guided stereotaxic surgery to produce selective hippocampal lesions in five monkeys, and retained five unoperated control monkeys. In the study phase of each trial of the matching-to-location task, monkeys found food in one site in an array of identical foraging sites. During the test, which occurred after a delay, monkeys could return to the site where the food had been found during study to obtain more food. In Experiment 1, normal monkeys showed a small significant tendency to return directly to a site where they had previously found food that day. Operated monkeys showed no such matching tendency. In Experiment 2, further training produced reliable matching-to-location performance in both groups at short delays, but monkeys with selective hippocampal lesions rapidly forgot the location of the food. In Experiment 3, we tested whether monkeys used a ``cognitive map'' to encode the location of the hidden food, by requiring them to relocate the food from a starting location different from that used during study. As a group, monkeys were more accurate than expected by chance, indicating that they did encode the rewarded location with respect to allocentric landmarks; however, both groups of monkeys were significantly worse at relocating the food when required to approach from a different location. In Experiment 4, probe trials using symmetrical test arrays found no evidence for egocentric coding of the rewarded location.",

First, animal models are perforce comparative, but the principles of comparative and evolutionary biology have not featured prominently in developing the orthodox model. Second, no one understands the relationship between human consciousness and cognition in other animals, but the orthodox model implicitly assumes a close correspondence. If we treat these two difficulties with the deference they deserve, monkeys can tell us a lot about human amnesia and memory. Three future contributions seem most likely: (1) an improved monkey model, one refocused on the hippocampus rather than on the medial temporal lobe as a whole; (2) a better understanding of cortical areas unique to primates, especially the granular prefrontal cortex; and (3), taking the two together, insight into prefrontal-hippocampal interactions. We propose that interactions among the granular prefrontal areas create the kind of cross-domain, analogical and self-referential knowledge that underlies advanced cognition in modern humans. When these products of frontal-lobe function interact with the hippocampus, and its ancestral function in navigation, what emerges is the human ability to embed ourselves in scenarios-real and imagined, self-generated and received-thereby creating a coherent, conscious life experience.",

We designed an apparatus that allows birds to cache and retrieve food at many sites while navigating in a laboratory arena. This apparatus enabled automated tracking of behavioral variables - including caches, retrievals, and investigations of different sites. We built probabilistic models to fit these behavioral data using a combination of mnemonic and non-mnemonic factors. We found that chickadees use some navigational strategies that are independent of cache memories, including opportunistic foraging and spatial biases. They combine these strategies with spatially precise memories of which sites contain caches and which sites they have previously checked. A single memory of site contents is used in a context-dependent manner: during caching chickadees avoid sites that contain food, while during retrieval they instead preferentially access occupied sites. Our approach is a powerful way to investigate navigational decisions in a natural behavior, including flexible contributions of memory to these decisions.",

  abstract = "With time and experience, memories undergo a process of reorganization that involves different neuronal networks, known as systems consolidation. The traditional view, as articulated in standard consolidation theory (SCT), is that (episodic and semantic) memories initially depend on the hippocampus, but eventually become consolidated in their original forms in other brain regions. In this study, we review the main principles of SCT and report evidence from the neuropsychological literature that would not be predicted by this theory. By comparison, the evidence supports an alternative account, the transformation hypothesis, whose central premise is that changes in neural representation in systems consolidation are accompanied by corresponding changes in the nature of the memory. According to this view, hippocampally dependent, episodic, or context-specific memories transform into semantic or gist-like versions that are represented in extra-hippocampal structures. To the extent that episodic memories are retained, they will continue to require the hippocampus, but the hippocampus is not needed for the retrieval of semantic memories. The transformation hypothesis emphasizes the dynamic nature of memory, as well as the underlying functional and neural interactions that must be taken into account in a comprehensive theory of memory.",

To begin to understand the contribution of entorhinal cells to different forms of memory, responses of entorhinal cells were recorded as monkeys performed either an object or place memory task. The object memory task was a variation of delayed matching to sample. A sample picture was presented at the start of the trial, followed by a variable sequence of zero to four test pictures, ending with a repetition of the sample (i.e., a match). The place memory task was a variation of delayed matching to place. In this task, a cue stimulus was presented at a variable sequence of one to four ``places'' on a computer screen, ending with a repetition of one of the previously shown places (i.e., a match). For both tasks, the animals were rewarded for releasing a bar to the match. To solve these tasks, the monkey must 1) discriminate the stimuli, 2) maintain a memory of the appropriate stimuli during the course of the trial, and 3) evaluate whether a test stimulus matches previously presented stimuli. The responses of entorhinal cortex neurons were consistent with a role in all three of these processes in both tasks. We found that 47\% and 55\% of the visually responsive entorhinal cells responded selectively to the different objects or places presented during the object or place task, respectively. Similar to previous findings in prefrontal but not perirhinal cortex on the object task, some entorhinal cells had sample-specific delay activity that was maintained throughout all of the delay intervals in the sequence. For the place task, some cells had location-specific maintained activity in the delay immediately following a specific cue location. In addition, 59\% and 22\% of the visually responsive cells recorded during the object and place task, respectively, responded differently to the test stimuli according to whether they were matching or non-matching to the stimuli held in memory. Responses of some cells were enhanced to matching stimuli, whereas others were suppressed. This suppression or enhancement typically occurred well before the animals' behavioral response, suggesting that this information could be used to perform the task. These results indicate that entorhinal cells receive sensory information about both objects and spatial locations and that their activity carries information about objects and locations held in short-term memory.",

Patients with lesions of the temporal lobe show marked impairment in this test. In our study, we trained monkeys in a pair-association task using a set of computer-generated paired patterns. We found two types of task-related neurons in the anterior temporal cortex. One type selectively responded to both pictures of the paired associates. The other type, which had the strongest response to one picture during the cue presentation, exhibited increasing activity during the delay period when the associate of that picture was used as a cue.

It has been hypothesized that acquisition of such long-term associative memories proceeds via the strengthening of connections between neurons representing the associated stimuli, such that a neuron initially responding only to one stimulus of an associated pair eventually comes to respond to both. Consistent with this hypothesis, studies have demonstrated that individual neurons in the primate inferior temporal cortex tend to exhibit similar responses to pairs of visual stimuli that have become behaviorally associated. In the present study, we investigated the role of these areas in the formation of conditional visual associations by monitoring the responses of individual neurons during the learning of new stimulus pairs. We found that many neurons in both area TE and perirhinal cortex came to elicit more similar neuronal responses to paired stimuli as learning proceeded. Moreover, these neuronal response changes were learning-dependent and proceeded with an average time course that paralleled learning. This experience-dependent plasticity of sensory representations in the cerebral cortex may underlie the learning of associations between objects.",

A large population of hippocampal neurons (50\%) signaled trial outcome by differentiating between correct and error trials during the period after the behavioral response. About half these cells increased their activity following correct trials (correct up cells) while the remaining half fired more following error trials (error up cells). Moreover, correct up cells, but not error up cells, conveyed information about learning by increasing their stimulus-selective response properties with behavioral learning.

Neurons were recorded from monkeys during performance of a visual discrimination task in which a predictor stimulus was followed, after a delay, by a GO or NO-GO choice stimulus. Association learning had two major influences on neuronal responses. First, responses to frequently paired predictor-choice stimuli were more similar to one another than was the case with infrequently paired stimuli. Second, the magnitude of activity during the delay was correlated with the magnitude of responses to both the predictor and choice stimuli. Both of these learning effects were found only for stimulus pairs that had been associated on at least 2 d of training. Early in training, the delay activity was correlated only with the response to the predictor stimuli. Thus, with long-term training, perirhinal neurons tend to link the representations of temporally associated stimuli.",

To investigate the origin of IT image memorability modulation, we probed convolutional neural network models trained to categorize objects. We found that, like the brain, different natural images evoked different magnitude responses from these networks, and in higher layers, larger magnitude responses were correlated with the images that humans and monkeys find most memorable.

PF cells have properties consistent with a role in all three of these operations. Approximately 25\% of the cells responded selectively to different visual stimuli. Half of the cells showed heightened activity during the delay after the sample and, for many of these cells, the magnitude of delay activity was selective for different samples. Finally, more than half of the cells responded differently to the test stimuli depending on whether they matched the sample. Because inferior temporal (IT) cortex also is important for working memory, we compared PF cells with IT cells studied in the same task. Compared with IT cortex, PF responses were less often stimulus-selective but conveyed more information about whether a given test stimulus was a match to the sample. Furthermore, sample-selective delay activity in PF cortex was maintained throughout the trial even when other test stimuli intervened during the delay, whereas delay activity in IT cortex was disrupted by intervening stimuli.

Our previous studies on single neurons in the anterior inferotemporal (AIT) cortex suggested their roles in representing paired associates in the mind. To test the possibility that the delay activity of AIT neurons is related to a particular picture as a sought target, we devised the PA with color switch (PACS) task. In the PACS task, the necessity for memory retrieval and its initiation time were controlled by a color switch in the middle of the delay period. A control task, in which there is no color switch, corresponds to the conventional delayed matching-to-sample (DMS) task where the monkey chooses the same picture as a cue. We found that AIT neurons started to respond just after the color switch in the PACS task, when the cue-optimal picture's associate was presented as a cue. In contrast, they showed no response change in the DMS task. We confirmed that this effect is not due to the visual response to colors. Furthermore, when the cue-optimal picture was presented as a cue, these neurons showed suppression after the color switch in the PACS task. These results suggest that the activity of AIT neurons mediates gating mechanisms that preferentially pass information about a sought target, even when the sought target is retrieved from long-term memory.",

After training with 12 pairs of pictures, single units were recorded from the inferotemporal cortex of the monkeys as the control. By injecting a grid of ibotenic acid, we unilaterally lesioned the entorhinal and perirhinal cortex, which provides massive direct and indirect backward projections ipsilaterally to the inferotemporal cortex. After the lesion, the monkeys fixated the cue stimulus normally, relearned the preoperatively learned set (set A), and learned a new set (set B) of paired associates. Then, single units were recorded from the same area as for the prelesion control. We found that (i) in spite of the lesion, the sampled neurons responded strongly and selectively to both the set A and set B patterns and (ii) the paired associates elicited significantly correlated responses in the control neurons before the lesion but not in the cells tested after the lesion, either for set A or set B stimuli. We conclude that the ability of inferotemporal neurons to represent association between picture pairs was lost after the lesion of entorhinal and perirhinal cortex, most likely through disruption of backward neural signals to the inferotemporal neurons, while the ability of the neurons to respond to a particular visual stimulus was left intact.",

  abstract = "The medial temporal lobe includes a system of anatomically related structures that are essential for declarative memory (conscious memory for facts and events). The system consists of the hippocampal region (CA fields, dentate gyrus, and subicular complex) and the adjacent perirhinal, entorhinal, and parahippocampal cortices. Here, we review findings from humans, monkeys, and rodents that illuminate the function of these structures. Our analysis draws on studies of human memory impairment and animal models of memory impairment, as well as neurophysiological and neuroimaging data, to show that this system (a) is principally concerned with memory, (b) operates with neocortex to establish and maintain long-term memory, and (c) ultimately, through a process of consolidation, becomes independent of long-term memory, though questions remain about the role of perirhinal and parahippocampal cortices in this process and about spatial memory in rodents. Data from neurophysiology, neuroimaging, and neuroanatomy point to a division of labor within the medial temporal lobe. However, the available data do not support simple dichotomies between the functions of the hippocampus and the adjacent medial temporal cortex, such as associative versus nonassociative memory, episodic versus semantic memory, and recollection versus familiarity.",

However, it remains elusive whether and how object percepts alone, or concomitantly a nonphysical attribute of the objects (``learned''), are decoded from perirhinal activities. By combining monkey psychophysics with optogenetic and electrical stimulations, we found a focal spot of memory neurons where both stimulations led monkeys to preferentially judge presented objects as ``already seen.'' In an adjacent fringe area, where neurons did not exhibit selective responses to the learned objects, electrical stimulation induced the opposite behavioral bias toward ``never seen before,'' whereas optogenetic stimulation still induced bias toward ``already seen.'' These results suggest that mnemonic judgment of objects emerges via the decoding of their nonphysical attributes encoded by perirhinal neurons.",

These abilities might help to explain why Japanese macaques can maintain an exceptionally broad diet and why they can use new food sources, find last year's acorns under leaf piles, and adjust to seasonal changes in the availability of food.

In non-human animals, the behavioural criterion for episodic-like memory is remembering ``what'' occurred in conjunction with ``when'' and ``where'' (Clayton and Dickinson in Nature 395:272-274, 1998). We conducted tests for ``what, where, and when'' memory in a food-storing bird, the black-capped chickadee (Poecile atricapillus). In Experiment 1, chickadees found sunflower seeds and mealworms in concealed sites in their home cage. Birds later re-visited these sites after either a short (3 h) or long (123 h) retention interval. Chickadees normally prefer mealworms, but at the long retention interval mealworms were degraded in taste and appearance. Chickadees showed some memory for what kind of food they had encountered and where, but no memory for when food had previously been found. Experiment 2 followed a similar procedure, except that chickadees searched for hidden sunflower seeds and mealworms in trees in an indoor aviary. These more natural conditions increased both the spatial scale of the task and the effort required to find food. In this experiment, birds showed evidence for all three components of what-where-when memory. Unlike some previous studies of episodic-like memory, birds' behaviour cannot be accounted for by differential memory strength for more recent events. The results show that memory for what, where, and when occurs in food-storing birds outside the corvid family, does not require food caching or retrieval, and that remembering ``when'' can depend on the nature of the task.",

Here we review recent progress in understanding how these correlations affect population information, how information should be quantified, and what mechanisms may give rise to correlations. As population coding theory has improved, it has made clear that some forms of correlation are more important for information than others. We argue that this is a critical lesson for those interested in neuronal population responses more generally: Descriptions of population responses should be motivated by and linked to well-specified function. Within this context, we offer suggestions of where current theoretical frameworks fall short.",

In the present study, we tested whether memory encoding is put forward at this stage, i.e., whether association between the representations of different but semantically linked objects proceeds forward from TE to A36. To address this question, we trained monkeys in a pair-association (PA) memory task, after which single-unit activities were recorded from TE and A36 during PA trials. Neurons in both areas showed stimulus-selective cue responses (347 in TE, 76 in A36; ``cue-selective neurons'') that provided, at the population level, mnemonic linkage between the paired associates. The percentage of neurons in which responses to the paired associates were significantly (p < 0.01) correlated at the single-neuron level (``pair-coding neuron'') dramatically increased from TE (4.9\% of the cue-selective neurons) to A36 (33\%). The pair-coding neurons in A36 were further separable into Type1 (68\%) and Type2 (32\%) on the basis of their initial transient responses after cue stimulus presentation. Type1 neurons, but not Type2 neurons, began to encode association between paired stimuli as soon as they exhibited stimulus selectivity. Thus, the representation of long-term memory encoded by Type1 neurons in A36 is likely substantiated without feedback input from other higher centers. Therefore, we conclude that association between the representations of the paired associates proceeds forward at this critical step within IT cortex, suggesting selective convergence onto a single A36 neuron from two TE neurons that encode separate visual objects.",

We corroborate and extend these results with a novel experiment, directly comparing PRC-intact human performance to electrophysiological recordings from the macaque VVS: PRC-intact participants outperform a linear readout of high-level visual cortex.

  abstract = "Some have claimed that the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) mediates decision making. Others suggest mPFC is selectively involved in the retrieval of remote long-term memory. Yet others suggests mPFC supports memory and consolidation on time scales ranging from seconds to days. How can all these roles be reconciled? We propose that the function of the mPFC is to learn associations between context, locations, events, and corresponding adaptive responses, particularly emotional responses. Thus, the ubiquitous involvement of mPFC in both memory and decision making may be due to the fact that almost all such tasks entail the ability to recall the best action or emotional response to specific events in a particular place and time. An interaction between multiple memory systems may explain the changing importance of mPFC to different types of memories over time. In particular, mPFC likely relies on the hippocampus to support rapid learning and memory consolidation.",

  abstract = "Declarative knowledge and experiences are represented in the association cortex and are recalled by reactivation of the neural representation. Electrophysiological experiments have revealed that associations between semantically linked visual objects are formed in neural representations in the temporal and limbic cortices. Memory traces are created by the reorganization of neural circuits. These regions are reactivated during retrieval and contribute to the contents of a memory. Two different types of retrieval signals are suggested as follows: automatic and active. One flows backward from the medial temporal lobe during the automatic retrieval process, whereas the other is conveyed as a top-down signal from the prefrontal cortex to the temporal cortex during the active retrieval process. By sending the top-down signal, the prefrontal cortex manipulates and organizes to-be-remembered information, devises strategies for retrieval and monitors the outcome. To further understand the neural mechanism of memory, the following two complementary views are needed: how the multiple cortical areas in the brain-wide network interact to orchestrate cognitive functions and how the properties of single neurons and their synaptic connections with neighbouring neurons combine to form local circuits and to exhibit the function of each cortical area. We will discuss some new methodological innovations that tackle these challenges.",

Responses of 120 (9.7\%) of the visually responsive neurons recorded were significantly smaller to the second than to the first presentations of unfamiliar stimuli. The incidence of such responses was highest in perirhinal cortex plus areas TE1 and TE2 of the temporal lobe, intermediate in lateral entorhinal cortex and areas TE3 and TG, and lowest in other parts of entorhinal and inferior temporal cortex. Response decrements were maintained across 20 or more intervening presentations of other stimuli for the majority of the neurones tested. Responses of 43 (14.4\%) of the visually responsive neurones tested were significantly greater to unfamiliar than to highly familiar stimuli. Such differential responses were found only in lateral entorhinal and perirhinal cortex plus areas TG, TE1, TE2 and TE3. For 6 neurones the response difference was significant even when the familiar stimuli had not been seen for more than 24 h: such neurones demonstrate access to information stored in long-term memory for more than 24 h. Seven familiarity neurones signalled information concerning the relative familiarity of stimuli but not information concerning how recently they were last seen; 58 recency neurones signalled information concerning the recency of presentation of stimuli, but not their relative familiarity. Thus certain neurones demonstrate the separable encoding of recency and familiarity information. Neurones signalling information of use for recognition memory are found in cortex close to the rhinal sulcus where lesions result in major deficits in the performance of recognition memory tasks. The conjunction of these findings provides strong evidence for the importance of these neurones and this cortex for processes (recency and familiarity discrimination) necessary for recognition and working memory. The possible relation of the neuronal responses to priming memory is also discussed.",

  abstract = "Long-term memory is often considered easily corruptible, imprecise and inaccurate, especially in comparison to working memory. However, most research used to support these findings relies on weak long-term memories: those where people have had only one brief exposure to an item. Here we investigated the fidelity of visual long-term memory in more naturalistic setting, with repeated exposures, and ask how it compares to visual working memory fidelity. Using psychophysical methods designed to precisely measure the fidelity of visual memory, we demonstrate that long-term memory for the color of frequently seen objects is as accurate as working memory for the color of a single item seen 1 second ago. In particular, we show that repetition greatly improves long-term memory, including the ability to discriminate an item from a very similar item ('fidelity'), in both a lab setting (Exps. 1-3) and a naturalistic setting (brand logos, Exp. 4). Overall our results demonstrate the impressive nature of visual long-term memory fidelity, which we find is even higher fidelity than previously indicated in situations involving repetitions. Furthermore, our results suggest that there is no distinction between the fidelity of visual working memory and visual long-term memory, but instead both memory systems are capable of storing similar incredibly high fidelity memories under the right circumstances. Our results also provide further evidence that there is no fundamental distinction between the ‘precision’ of memory and the ‘likelihood of retrieving a memory’, instead suggesting a single continuous measure of memory strength best accounts for working and long-term memory.",

The animals were paralyzed and anesthetized with nitrous oxide. All MT neurons (n = 614) responded better to moving stimuli than to stationary stimuli. For 55\% of the neurons, responses to moving stimuli were independent of stimulus color, shape, length, or orientation. For the remaining cells, stimulus length affected the response magnitude and tuning bandwidth but not the preferred direction. MT neurons were divided into four categories on the basis of their sensitivity to moving stimuli: 60\% responded exclusively to one direction of motion, 24\% responded best to one direction with a weaker response in the opposite direction, 8\% responded equally well to two opposite directions of motion, and 8\% responded equally well to all directions of motion. The direction preferences of successively sampled cells on a penetration either changed by small increments or occasionally by approximately 180 degrees. Thus, there is a systematic representation of direction of motion. The representation of axis of motion, i.e., the orientation of the path along which a stimulus moves, is more continuous than the representation of direction of motion. There was a systematic relationship between penetration angle and rate of change of preferred axis of motion, indicating that cells with a similar axis of motion preference are arranged in vertical columns. Furthermore, axis of motion columns appear to exist in the form of continuous slabs in area MT. The size of these slabs is such that 180 degrees of axis of motion are represented in 400-500 micron of cortex. There was also a systematic relationship between penetration angle and frequency of 180 degrees reversals, indicating that cells with a similar direction of motion preference are also organized in vertical columns and cells with opposite direction preferences are located in adjacent columns within a single axis of motion column. Just as in macaque striate cortex where approximately 500 micron of cortex contain the mechanism for the local analysis of stimulus orientation, so in MT approximately 500 micron of cortex contain the mechanism for the local analysis of stimulus motion.",

The depth of information transfer remains to be thoroughly investigated. Area LIP, as part of the dorsal visual stream, is regarded as a spatially selective area, yet there is evidence that LIP neurons also encode object features. We sought to determine whether LIP remaps shape information. This knowledge is important for understanding what information is retained from each glance. We identified 82 remapping neurons. First, we presented shapes within the receptive field and tested for shape selectivity in a fixation task. Among the remapping neurons, 28 neurons (34\%) were selective for shape. Second, we presented the same shapes in the future location of the receptive field around the time of the saccade and tested for shape selectivity during remapping. Thirty-one (38\%) neurons were selective for shape. Of 11 neurons that were shape selective in both tasks, 5 showed significant correlation between shape selectivity in the two tasks. Across the population, there was a weak but significant correlation between responses to shape in the two tasks.

One directional signal was generated by a visual stimulus and a second signal was introduced by electrically stimulating neurons that encoded a specific direction of motion. The decisions made by the monkeys in response to the two signals allowed a distinction to be made between two possible mechanisms for interpreting directional signals in MT. The monkeys tended to cast decisions in favor of one or the other signal, indicating that the signals exerted independent effects on performance and that an interactive mechanism such as vector averaging of the two signals was not operative.

We tested this hypothesis by measuring the effects of cortical microstimulation on perceptual judgements of motion direction. To accomplish this, rhesus monkeys were trained to discriminate the direction of motion in a near-threshold, stochastic motion display. For each experiment, we positioned a microelectrode in the middle of a cluster of neurons that shared a common preferred direction of motion. The psychophysical task was then adjusted so that the visual display was presented directly over the neurons' receptive field. The monkeys were required to discriminate between motion shown either in the direction preferred by the neurons or in the opposite direction. On half the trials of an experiment, we applied electrical microstimulation while monkeys viewed the motion display. We hypothesized that enhancing the neurons' discharge rate would introduce a directionally specific signal into the cortex and thereby influence the monkeys' choices on the discrimination task. We compared the monkeys' performance on ``stimulated'' and ``nonstimulated'' trials in 139 experiments; all trials within an experiment were presented in random order. Statistically significant effects of microstimulation were obtained in 89 experiments. In 86 of the 89 experiments with significant effects (97\%), the monkeys indicated that motion was in the neurons' preferred direction more frequently on stimulated trials than on nonstimulated trials.

  abstract = "We have previously shown that perceptual judgements of motion direction are based in part on the activity of direction selective neurons in extrastriate visual area MT (Salzman et al., 1990, 1992). In those experiments, we applied low-amplitude microstimulation pulses (10 microA, 200 Hz) to clusters of MT neurons whose preferred directions were similar. The effect of microstimulation was to bias the monkeys' choices on a direction discrimination task toward the preferred direction of neurons at the stimulation site. The results suggest that microstimulation generated a directionally specific cortical signal by activating selectively neurons near the electrode tip. To test this notion more directly, we have now examined the behavioral effects of varying current amplitude, current frequency, and electrode position. In the majority of experiments, the directional bias in the monkeys' choices was reduced or eliminated as current amplitude increased to 80 microA. In addition, 80 microA stimulating pulses frequently impaired overall performance as measured by the percentage of correct responses. This decrement in performance indicated that 80 microA pulses introduced ``noise'' into the neural circuitry encoding motion direction, presumably by increasing current spread to activate a larger population of neurons representing all directions of motion. In contrast, increasing current frequency to 500 Hz (10 microA pulses) preserved the directional specificity of microstimulation effects. The precise position of the stimulating electrode also influenced the magnitude of microstimulation effects; in some cases, differences in position on the order of 100 microns determined whether an experiment yielded a very large effect or no effect at all. Thus, directionally specific activation of cortical circuitry within MT can be disrupted by increases in current spread or by small changes in electrode position. These observations suggest that the effects of low-amplitude microstimulation depend upon direct activation of a well-localized population of neurons.",

Direction selectivity of 110 MT neurons was studied with three types of moving stimuli: slits, single spots, and random-dot fields. All of the MT neurons were found to be directionally selective using one or more of these stimuli. MT neurons exhibited a broad range of direction-tuning bandwidths to all stimuli (minimum = 32 degrees, maximum = 186 degrees, mean = 95 degrees). On average, responses were strongly unidirectional and of similar magnitude for all three stimulus types. Orientation selectivity of 89 MT neurons was studied with stationary flashed slits. Eighty-three percent were found to be orientation selective. Overall, orientation-tuning bandwidths were significantly narrower (mean = 64 degrees) than direction-tuning bandwidths for moving stimuli. Moreover, responses to stationary-oriented stimuli were generally smaller than those to moving stimuli. Direction selectivity of 55 V1 neurons was studied with moving slits; orientation selectivity of 52 V1 neurons was studied with stationary flashed slits. In V1, compared with MT, direction-tuning bandwidths were narrower (mean = 68 degrees). Moreover, V1 responses to moving stimuli were weaker, and bidirectional tuning was more common. The mean orientation-tuning bandwidth in V1 was also significantly narrower than that in MT (mean = 52 degrees), but the responses to stationary-oriented stimuli were of similar magnitude in the two areas. We examined the relationship between optimal direction and optimal orientation for MT neurons and found that 61\% had an orientation preference nearly perpendicular to the preferred direction of motion, as is the case for all V1 neurons. However, another 29\% of MT neurons had an orientation preference roughly parallel to the preferred direction. These observations, when considered together with recent reports claiming sensitivity of some MT neurons to moving visual patterns (39), suggest specific neural mechanisms underlying pattern-motion sensitivity in area MT. These results support the notion that area MT represents a further specialization over area V1 for stimulus motion processing. Furthermore, the marked similarities between direction and orientation tuning in area MT in macaque and owl monkey support the suggestion that these areas are homologues.",

We investigated the role of MT in visual perception by examining the effect of chemical lesions of MT on psychophysical thresholds. We trained rhesus monkeys on psychophysical tasks that enabled us to assess their sensitivity to motion and to contrast. For motion psychophysics, we employed a dynamic random dot display that permitted us to vary the intensity of a motion signal in the midst of masking motion noise. We measured the threshold intensity for which the monkey could successfully complete a direction discrimination. In the contrast task, we measured the threshold contrast for which the monkeys could successfully discriminate the orientation of stationary gratings. Injections of ibotenic acid into MT caused striking elevations in motion thresholds, but had little or no effect on contrast thresholds. The results indicate that neural activity in MT contributes selectively to the perception of motion.",

Previous analyses of this problem have compared the performance of human or animal observers in detection or discrimination tasks with the signals carried by individual neurons, but have been hampered because neuronal and perceptual data were not obtained at the same time and under the same conditions. We have now measured the performance of monkeys and of visual cortical neurons while the animals performed a psychophysical task well matched to the properties of the neurons under study. Here we report that the reliability and sensitivity of most neurons on this task equalled or exceeded that of the monkeys. We therefore suggest that under our conditions, psychophysical judgements could be based on the activity of a relatively small number of neurons.",

Recent neurophysiological results suggest that the central processing of evidence leading to a perceptual decision also establishes a level of confidence. Here we provide a causal test of this hypothesis by electrically stimulating areas of the visual cortex involved in motion perception. Monkeys discriminated the direction of motion in a noisy display and were sometimes allowed to opt out of the direction choice if their confidence was low. Microstimulation did not reduce overall confidence in the decision but instead altered confidence in a manner that mimicked a change in visual motion, plus a small increase in sensory noise. The results suggest that the same sensory neural signals support choice, reaction time, and confidence in a decision and that artificial manipulation of these signals preserves the quantitative relationship between accumulated evidence and confidence.",

This is followed by a discussion of recent claims that the concept of a short-term store be replaced by an interpretation in terms of activated long-term memory.

Evidence for this view comes from studies in which subjects hold a stimulus across a delay lasting up to several seconds. Persistent elevated activity in the PFC has been observed in animal models as well as in humans performing these tasks. This persistent activity has been interpreted as evidence for the encoding of the stimulus itself in working memory. However, recent findings have posed a challenge to this notion. A number of recent studies have examined neural data from the PFC and posterior sensory areas, both at the single neuron level in primates, and at a larger scale in humans, and have failed to find encoding of stimulus information in the PFC during tasks with a substantial working memory component. Strong stimulus related information, however, was seen in posterior sensory areas. These results suggest that delay period activity in the PFC might be better understood not as a signature of memory storage per se, but as a top down signal that influences posterior sensory areas where the actual working memory representations are maintained.",

However, optimizing for object classification alone does not constrain how other variables may be encoded in high-level visual representations. Here, we studied how the latent sources of variation in a visual scene are encoded within high-dimensional population codes in primate visual cortex and in deep neural networks (DNNs). In particular, we focused on the degree to which different sources of variation are represented in non-overlapping (``factorized'') subspaces of population activity. In the monkey ventral visual hierarchy, we found that factorization of object pose and background information from object identity increased in higher-level regions. To test the importance of factorization in computational models of the brain, we then conducted a detailed large-scale analysis of factorization of individual scene parameters -- lighting, background, camera viewpoint, and object pose -- in a diverse library of DNN models of the visual system. Models which best matched neural, fMRI and behavioral data from both monkeys and humans across 12 datasets tended to be those which factorized scene parameters most strongly. In contrast, invariance to object pose and camera viewpoint in models was negatively associated with a match to neural and behavioral data. Intriguingly, we found that factorization was similar in magnitude and complementary to classification performance as an indicator of the most brainlike models suggesting a new principle. Thus, we propose that factorization of visual scene information is a widely used strategy in brains and DNN models. \#\#\# Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest.",

Previous electrophysiological studies suggested that macaque A36 is involved in both association and retrieval processes during a visual pair-association task. However, the neuronal properties of macaque A35 have never been examined because A35 is located in a very narrow region, which makes it difficult to systematically record single-unit activity from there. In the present study, we overcame this technical difficulty for targeting A35 by combining magnetic resonance imaging-guided in-vivo localization with postmortem histological localization. This two-track approach enabled us to record from 181 A35 neurons in two macaque monkeys while they performed a pair-association task. Among these neurons, 64 showed stimulus-selective responses during the cue period (cue-selective neurons), whereas 18 did during the delay period (delay-selective neurons). As in A36, the responses of cue-selective neurons in A35 to paired associates were correlated. In both areas, these correlations were stronger in neurons showing delay selectivity than in those without delay selectivity. Notably, delay-selective neurons in A35 responded similarly to the optimal stimulus and its paired associate, whereas delay-selective neurons in A36 discriminated between them. However, these neurons in both areas discriminated the primary pair, consisting of the optimal stimulus and its paired associate, from other pairs, indicating that selectivity across pairs was maintained between the two areas. These results suggest that delay-selective neurons in A35 represent these paired stimuli as a single unitized item rather than two associated items.",

We determined the system's ex vivo localization accuracy to be better than 50 microm, and we show how we have used this method to coregister hundreds of deep-brain microelectrode recordings in monkeys to a common frame of reference with median error of <150 microm. We further show how we can coregister those sites with magnetic resonance images (MRIs), allowing for comparison with anatomy, and laying the groundwork for more detailed electrophysiology/functional MRI comparison. Minimally, this method allows one to marry the single-cell specificity of microelectrode recording with the spatial mapping abilities of imaging techniques; furthermore, it has the potential of yielding fundamentally new kinds of high-resolution maps of brain function.",

Without recall, memory is more limited to recognition of the immediate environment. Amnesic patients are impaired on recall tests [1, 2], and recall performance often declines with aging [3]. Despite its importance, we know relatively little about nonhuman animals' ability to recall information; we lack suitable recall tests for them and depend instead on recognition tests to measure nonhuman memory. Here we report that rhesus monkeys can recall simple shapes from memory and reproduce them on a touchscreen. As in humans [4, 5], monkeys remembered less in recall than recognition tests, and their recall performance deteriorated more slowly.

The superior colliculus exhibits robust encoding of learned visual categories, which is stronger than in the posterior parietal cortex and arises at a similar latency in the two areas.

We recorded from QA neurons of S1 while monkeys performed the vibrotactile discrimination task. We found that the periodic mechanical vibrations can be represented both in the periodicity and in the firing rate responses to varying degrees across the QA neuronal population. We then computed neurometric functions by using both the periodicity and the firing rate and sought to determine which of these two measures is associated with the psychophysical performance. We found that neurometric thresholds based on the firing rate are very similar to the animal's psychometric thresholds whereas neurometric thresholds based on periodicity are far lower than those thresholds. These results indicate that an observer could solve this task with a precision similar to that of the monkey, based only on the firing rate produced during the stimulus periods.",

These proteins allowed us to identify encoding neurons several days after learning and silence them with laser stimulation.

Other animals were fitted with converse implants: cooling probes over a portion of the inferotemporal cortical convexity and microelectrode pedestals over prefrontal cortex. In the awake and behaving monkeys, bilateral cooling of either the prefrontal or the inferotemporal region (to 20 degrees C) induced, in the other region, reversible changes of spontaneous and task-related cell discharge. In the two cortices remote cooling induced augmentations and diminutions of cell reaction to the color samples which the animal had to retain for correct performance of the task. The same was true for cell discharge during the delay, the retention period which followed each sample. However, a net effect of remote cooling was, in both cortices, a diminution of color-dependent differences in the reactions and delay-discharge of some cells. Concomitantly, errors of task-performance increased. Cells that as a result of remote cortical cooling showed changes of reaction to the color samples were found more commonly in supragranular than infragranular layers. The results are interpreted as evidence of mutual influences between inferotemporal and prefrontal areas, probably mediated by corticocortical connections. The single-cell data, together with the behavioral data, suggest that those influences are functionally important for visual discrimination and short-term memory.",

Here we describe an initial study of neural responses in the lateral intraparietal area (LIP) of the cerebral cortex while alert monkeys discriminated the direction of motion in a visual display. A subset of LIP neurons carried high-level signals that may comprise a neural correlate of the decision process in our task. These signals are neither sensory nor motor in the strictest sense; rather they appear to reflect integration of sensory signals toward a decision appropriate for guiding movement. If this ultimately proves to be the case, several fascinating issues in cognitive neuroscience will be brought under rigorous physiological scrutiny.",

One process responds weakly to error but retains information well, whereas the other responds strongly but has poor retention. This two-state learning system makes the surprising prediction of spontaneous recovery (or adaptation rebound) if error feedback is clamped at zero following an adaptation-extinction training episode. We used a novel paradigm to experimentally confirm this prediction in human motor learning of reaching, and we show that the interaction between the learning processes in this simple two-state system provides a unifying explanation for several different, apparently unrelated, phenomena in motor adaptation including savings, anterograde interference, spontaneous recovery, and rapid unlearning. Our results suggest that motor adaptation depends on at least two distinct neural systems that have different sensitivity to error and retain information at different rates.",

These neural networks and their modified synaptic connections can account for the cognitive basis of learning and memory and for memory deterioration in neurological disorders. We first discuss Hebb's (1949) theory that synaptic change and the formation of cell assemblies and phase sequences can link neurophysiology to cognitive processes. We then examine each of Trettenbrein's (2016) critiques of the synaptic theory in light of Hebb's theories and recent empirical data. We examine the biochemical basis of memory formation and the necessity of synaptic modification to form the neural networks underlying learning and memory. We then examine the use of Hebb's theories of synaptic change and cell assemblies for integrating neurophysiological and cognitive conceptions of learning and memory. We conclude with an examination of the applications of the Hebb synapse and cell assembly theories to the study of the neuroscience of learning and memory, the development of computational models of memory and the construction of ``intelligent'' robots.

Although previous functional neuroimaging studies have indicated that recency and repetition may modulate similar brain structures, particularly in the region of the inferior parietal cortex, there is extensive behavioral evidence that human subjects can make independent and accurate recognition memory judgments about both an item's recency and its frequency. In the present study, we used fMRI to examine patterns of brain activity during recognition memory for auditory-verbal stimuli that were parametrically and orthogonally manipulated in terms of recency and number of repetitions. We found in a continuous recognition paradigm that the lateral inferior parietal cortex, a region that has previously been associated with recollective forms of memory, is highly sensitive to recency but not repetition. In a multivariate analysis of whole-brain activation patterns, we found orthogonal components that dissociated recency and repetition variables, indicating largely independent neural bases underlying these two factors. The results demonstrate that although both recency and repetition dramatically improve recognition memory performance, the neural bases for this improvement are dissociable, and thus are difficult to explain in terms of access to a unitary memory trace.",

Consolidation is assumed to be a continual reduction in the fragility of the memory trace rather than any change in strength or availability. Decreasing fragility accounts for the continually decreasing forgetting rate, the temporal character of retrograde amnesia and recovery therefrom, and the type of internal clock necessary for nonassociative recency judgments.

We explored this possibility by assessing neuronal responses to familiar and novel images in rapid serial visual displays. Inferotemporal neurons responded more strongly to familiar than to novel images in such displays. The effect was stronger among putative inhibitory neurons than among putative excitatory neurons.

We developed the dual-eGRASP (green fluorescent protein reconstitution across synaptic partners) technique to examine synapses between engram cells to identify the specific neuronal site for memory storage. We found an increased number and size of spines on CA1 engram cells receiving input from CA3 engram cells. In contextual fear conditioning, this enhanced connectivity between engram cells encoded memory strength. CA3 engram to CA1 engram projections strongly occluded long-term potentiation. These results indicate that enhanced structural and functional connectivity between engram cells across two directly connected brain regions forms the synaptic correlate for memory formation.",

The biological realization of a memory is termed an engram-the enduring biochemical and physiological processes that enable learning and retrieval. The past decade has witnessed an explosion of engram research that suggests we are closing in on boundary conditions for what qualifies as the physical manifestation of memory. In this review, we provide a brief history of engram research, followed by an overview of the many rodent models available to probe memory with intersectional strategies that have yielded unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution over defined sets of cells. We then discuss the limitations and controversies surrounding engram research and subsequently attempt to reconcile many of these views both with data and by proposing a conceptual shift in the strategies utilized to study memory. We finally bridge this literature with human memory research and disorders of the brain and end by providing an experimental blueprint for future engram studies in mammals. Collectively, we believe that we are in an era of neuroscience where engram research has transitioned from ephemeral and philosophical concepts to provisional, tractable, experimental frameworks for studying the cellular, circuit and behavioral manifestations of memory.",

This aspect of eye movement based memory investigations is particularly useful when eye movement methods are used with special populations (e.g., young children, elderly individuals, and patients with severe amnesia), and also permits use of comparable paradigms in animals and humans, helping to bridge different memory literatures and permitting cross-species generalizations. Unique characteristics of eye movement methods have produced findings that challenge long-held views about the nature of memory, its organization in the brain, and its failures in special populations. Recently, eye movement methods have been successfully combined with neuroimaging techniques such as fMRI, single-unit recording, and magnetoencephalography, permitting more sophisticated investigations of memory. Ultimately, combined use of eye-tracking with neuropsychological and neuroimaging methods promises to provide a more comprehensive account of brain-behavior relationships and adheres to the ``converging evidence'' approach to cognitive neuroscience.",

We measured eye movements in young adults, older adults, and memory-impaired patients with damage to the medial temporal lobe as they viewed 120 novel scenes and 120 previously viewed scenes. Participants indicated if each scene was old or new and also gave a confidence rating for the memory judgment. Young adults and older adults explored old scenes less than they explored new scenes, but the patients did not. For the young and older adults, this effect was observed only when participants were aware of the scene’s familiar or novel status. In a second experiment, young adults viewed scenes that were either new, had been viewed previously, or had been viewed previously but had been changed (i.e., an object within the scene was either added or removed). The only instructions were to pay attention to the scenes and view each scene as it appeared, and there was no expectation that memory would be tested. Directly after the first altered scene was presented, participants were asked to classify the scene as new, old, or old but changed. Participants who were aware of the manipulation preferentially viewed the changed region, but participants who were unaware did not. These findings suggest that experience-dependent eye movements reflect hippocampus-dependent (and aware) memory, even when participants have no expectation that memory is being tested; and they are consistent with the view that awareness of what is learned is a fundamental characteristic of hippocampus-dependent memory.

We examined the dynamics of hippocampal activity as animals learned about new environments to understand how neural selectivity changes with experience. Hippocampal principal neurons fire when the animal is located in a particular subregion of its environment, and in any given environment the hippocampal representation is sparse: less than half of the neurons in areas CA1 and CA3 are active whereas the rest are essentially silent. Here we show that different dynamics govern the evolution of this sparsity in CA1 and upstream area CA3. CA1, but not CA3, produces twice as many spikes in novel compared with familiar environments. This high rate firing continues during sharp wave ripple events in a subsequent rest period. The overall CA1 population rate declines and the number of active cells decreases as the environment becomes familiar and task performance improves, but the decline in rate is not uniform across neurons. Instead, the activity of cells with initial peak spatial rates above approximately 12 Hz is enhanced, whereas the activity of cells with lower initial peak rates is suppressed. The result of these changes is that the active CA1 population comes to consist of a relatively small group of cells with strong spatial tuning. This process is not evident in CA3, indicating that a region-specific and long timescale process operates in CA1 to create a sparse, spatially informative population of neurons.",

The CA3 system operates as a single attractor or autoassociation network (1) to enable rapid one-trial associations between any spatial location (place in rodents or spatial view in primates) and an object or reward and (2) to provide for completion of the whole memory during recall from any part. The theory is extended to associations between time and object or reward to implement temporal order memory, which is also important in episodic memory. The dentate gyrus performs pattern separation by competitive learning to create sparse representations producing, for example, neurons with place-like fields from entorhinal cortex grid cells. The dentate granule cells generate, by the very small number of mossy fibre connections to CA3, a randomizing pattern separation effect that is important during learning but not recall and that separates out the patterns represented by CA3 firing as being very different from each other. This is optimal for an unstructured episodic memory system in which each memory must be kept distinct from other memories. The direct perforant path input to CA3 is quantitatively appropriate for providing the cue for recall in CA3 but not for learning. The CA1 recodes information from CA3 to set up associatively learned backprojections to the neocortex to allow the subsequent retrieval of information to the neocortex, giving a quantitative account of the large number of hippocampo-neocortical and neocortical-neocortical backprojections. Tests of the theory including hippocampal subregion analyses and hippocampal NMDA receptor knockouts are described and support the theory.",

A new part of the theory introduced here is a quantitative analysis of how backprojections from the hippocampus to the neocortex could lead to the recall of recent memories. The theory is then compared with other theories of hippocampal function. First, what is computed by the hippocampus is considered. The hypothesis the authors advocate, on the basis of the effects of damage to the hippocampus and neuronal activity recorded in it, is that it is involved in the formation of new memories by acting as an intermediate-term buffer store for information about episodes, particularly for spatial, but probably also for some nonspatial, information. The authors analyze how the hippocampus could perform this function, by producing a computational theory of how it operates, based on neuroanatomical and neurophysiological information about the different neuronal systems contained within the hippocampus. Key hypotheses are that the CA3 pyramidal cells operate as a single autoassociation network to store new episodic information as it arrives via a number of specialized preprocessing stages from many association areas of the cerebral cortex, and that the dentate granule cell/mossy fiber system is important, particularly during learning, to help to produce a new pattern of firing in the CA3 cells for each episode. The computational analysis shows how many memories could be stored in the hippocampus and how quickly the CA3 autoassociation system would operate during recall. The analysis is then extended to show how the CA3 system could be used to recall a whole episodic memory when only a fragment of it is presented. It is shown how this recall could operate using modified synapses in backprojection pathways from the hippocampus to the cerebral neocortex, resulting in reinstatement of neuronal activity in association areas of the cerebral neocortex similar to that present during the original episode. The recalled information in the cerebral neocortex could then be used by the neocortex in the formation of long-term memories.",

However, current findings are lacking as to whether the medial temporal lobe (MTL) and cortical regions are involved in the learning effect when subjects retrieve associative memory, and whether their activations differentially change over time due to learning experience. To address these issues, we designed an fMRI experiment in which face-scene pairs were learned once (L1) or six times (L6). Subjects learned the pairs at four retention intervals, 30-min, 1-day, 1-week and 1-month, after which they finished an associative recognition task in the scanner. The results showed that compared to learning once, learning six times led to stronger activation in the hippocampus, but weaker activation in the perirhinal cortex (PRC) as well as anterior ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vLPFC). In addition, the hippocampal activation was positively correlated with that of the parahippocampal place area (PPA) and negatively correlated with that of the vLPFC when the L6 group was compared to the L1 group. The hippocampal activation decreased over time after L1 but remained stable after L6. These results clarified how the hippocampus and cortical regions interacted to support associative memory after different learning experiences.",

Another factor affecting many phenomena is whether a manipulation of conditions occurs in randomized, within-subjects designs rather than between-subjects (or within-subject, blocked) designs. The fact that simple laws do not hold reveals the complex, interactive nature of memory phenomena. Nonetheless, the science of memory is robust, with most findings easily replicated under the same conditions as originally used, but when other variables are manipulated, effects may disappear or reverse.

Given the prevailing modular theoretical framework and the fact that prefrontal cortex receives inputs from both temporal and parietal streams, recent studies have focused on the role of prefrontal cortex in understanding where and how information about object identity is integrated with (or remains segregated from) information about object location. Here we show that many neurons in primate posterior parietal cortex (the 'where' pathway) show sensory shape selectivities to simple, two-dimensional geometric shapes while the animal performs a simple fixation task. In a delayed match-to-sample paradigm, many neuronal units also show significant differences in delay-period activity, and these differences depend on the shape of the sample. These results indicate that units in posterior parietal cortex contribute to attending to and remembering shape features in a way that is independent of eye movements, reaching, or object manipulation. These units show shape selectivity equivalent to any shown in the ventral pathway.",

The visual task was similar to a motion discrimination task that has been used in previous investigations of motion-sensitive regions of the extrastriate cortex. The monkeys were trained to decide whether the direction of motion was toward one of two choice targets that appeared on either side of the random-dot stimulus. At the end of the trial, the monkeys reported their direction judgment by making an eye movement to the appropriate target. We studied neurons in LIP that exhibited spatially selective persistent activity during delayed saccadic eye movement tasks. These neurons are thought to carry high-level signals appropriate for identifying salient visual targets and for guiding saccadic eye movements. We arranged the motion discrimination task so that one of the choice targets was in the LIP neuron's response field (RF) while the other target was positioned well away from the RF. During motion viewing, neurons in LIP altered their firing rate in a manner that predicted the saccadic eye movement that the monkey would make at the end of the trial. The activity thus predicted the monkey's judgment of motion direction. This predictive activity began early in the motion-viewing period and became increasingly reliable as the monkey viewed the random-dot motion. The neural activity predicted the monkey's direction judgment on both easy and difficult trials (strong and weak motion), whether or not the judgment was correct. In addition, the timing and magnitude of the response was affected by the strength of the motion signal in the stimulus. When the direction of motion was toward the RF, stronger motion led to larger neural responses earlier in the motion-viewing period. When motion was away from the RF, stronger motion led to greater suppression of ongoing activity. Thus the activity of single neurons in area LIP reflects both the direction of an impending gaze shift and the quality of the sensory information that instructs such a response. The time course of the neural response suggests that LIP accumulates sensory signals relevant to the selection of a target for an eye movement.",

RF characteristics of single LIP neurons could thus be measured repeatedly under different behavioral conditions. Here we report data obtained using a standard ocular fixation task during which the animals were required to monitor small changes in color of the fixated target. In a first step, statistical analyses were conducted in order to establish the experimental limits of the mapping procedure on 171 LIP neurons recorded from three hemispheres of two macaque monkeys. The characteristics of the receptive fields of LIP neurons were analyzed at the single cell and at the population level. Although for many neurons the assumption of a simple two-dimensional gaussian profile with a central area of maximal excitability at the center and progressively decreasing response strength at the periphery can represent relatively accurately the spatial structure of the RF, about 19\% of the cells had a markedly asymmetrical shape. At the population level, we observed, in agreement with prior studies, a systematic relation between RF size and eccentricity. However, we also found a more accentuated overrepresentation of the central visual field than had been previously reported and no marked differences between the upper and lower visual representation of space. This observation correlates with an extension of the definition of LIP from the posterior third of the lateral intraparietal sulcus to most of the middle and posterior thirds. Detailed histological analyses of the recorded hemispheres suggest that there exists, in this newly defined unitary functional cortical area, a coarse but systematic topographical organization in area LIP that supports the distinction between its dorsal and ventral regions, LIPd and LIPv, respectively. Paralleling the physiological data, the central visual field is mostly represented in the middle dorsal region and the visual periphery more ventral and posterior. An anteroposterior gradient from the lower to the upper visual field representations can also be identified. In conclusion, this study provides the basis for a reliable mapping method in awake monkeys and a reference for the organization of the properties of the visual space representation in an area LIP extended with respect to the previously described LIP and showing a relative emphasis of central visual field.",

In animals performing behavioral tasks, single neurons will typically encode several parameters simultaneously, such as stimuli, rewards, decisions, etc. When dealing with this large heterogeneity of responses, cells are conventionally classified into separate response categories using various statistical tools. However, this classical approach usually fails to account for the distributed nature of representations in higher cortical areas. Alternatively, principal component analysis (PCA) or related techniques can be employed to reduce the complexity of a data set while retaining the distributional aspect of the population activity. These methods, however, fail to explicitly extract the task parameters from the neural responses. Here we suggest a coordinate transformation that seeks to ameliorate these problems by combining the advantages of both methods. Our basic insight is that variance in neural firing rates can have different origins (such as changes in a stimulus, a reward, or the passage of time), and that, instead of lumping them together, as PCA does, we need to treat these sources separately. We present a method that seeks an orthogonal coordinate transformation such that the variance captured from different sources falls into orthogonal subspaces and is maximized within these subspaces. Using simulated examples, we show how this approach can be used to demix heterogeneous neural responses. Our method may help to lift the fog of response heterogeneity in higher cortical areas.",

Our theory predicts that the dimensions of the cerebellar granule-cell and Drosophila Kenyon-cell representations are maximized at degrees of synaptic connectivity that match those observed anatomically, showing that sparse connectivity is sometimes superior to dense connectivity.

The embodied Turing test shifts the focus from those capabilities like game playing and language that are especially well-developed or uniquely human to those capabilities - inherited from over 500 million years of evolution - that are shared with all animals. Building models that can pass the embodied Turing test will provide a roadmap for the next generation of AI.",

On average, single units and multiunits exhibited higher spike counts in response to targets relative to foils, and the size of this effect correlated with behavioral performance. Further analyses of the spike-count distributions revealed that (i) a small percentage of recorded neurons responded to any one target and (ii) a small percentage of targets elicited a strong response in any one neuron. These findings are consistent with the idea that in the human hippocampus episodic memory is supported by a sparse distributed neural code.",

Theta activity was intermittently present at movement onset and modulated by saccades. Many neurons were phase-locked to theta, with few showing phase precession. Most neurons encoded a mixture of spatial variables beyond place and grid tuning. Spatial representations were dominated by facing location and allocentric direction, mostly in head, rather than gaze, coordinates. Importantly, eye movements strongly modulated neural activity in all regions.

By contrast, anatomical studies and electrophysiological recordings in rodents suggest that the long axis is organized along a gradient. Together, these observations suggest a model in which functional long-axis gradients are superimposed on discrete functional domains.

We found that experience increased maximum responses of putative excitatory neurons but had the opposite effect on maximum responses of putative inhibitory neurons, an observation that helps to reconcile contradictory reports regarding the presence and direction of this effect. In addition, we found that experience reduced the average stimulus-evoked response in both cell classes, but this decrease was much more pronounced in putative inhibitory units.

The recognition test list was divided into two consecutive blocks; strong items appeared in one block, weak items in the other. If the change in item strength across blocks leads to a shift in criterion, the false alarm rate should change accordingly. In four experiments, the false alarm rates did not change across blocks, even when the difference between the strong and the weak items was magnified and marked with semantic cues. However, the strength of the items in the first test block affected the false alarm rate. Thus, strength cues influence initial criterion placement but fail to induce criterion shifts following permanent and even dramatic changes in item strength. These null findings are contrasted with those in a fifth experiment, in which accuracy feedback produced dynamic criterion shifts.",

Here the AUs find that with dynamic visual displays, neurons in the inferotemporal cortex respond more strongly to familiar than novel images. This indicates that familiarization sharpens the response dynamics of neurons in extrastriate visual cortex. Repeated viewing of an image over days and weeks induces a marked reduction in the strength with which neurons in monkey inferotemporal cortex respond to it. The processing advantage that attaches to this reduction is unknown. One possibility is that truncation of the response to a familiar image leaves neurons in a state of readiness to respond to ensuing images and thereby enhances their ability to track rapidly changing displays. We explored this possibility by assessing neuronal responses to familiar and novel images in rapid serial visual displays. Inferotemporal neurons responded more strongly to familiar than to novel images in such displays. The effect was stronger among putative inhibitory neurons than among putative excitatory neurons. A comparable effect occurred at the level of the scalp potential in humans. We conclude that long-term familiarization sharpens the response dynamics of neurons in both monkey and human extrastriate visual cortex.",

In the current article, these models are examined, along with the methods that have been developed to measure recollection and familiarity. The relevant empirical literature from behavioral, neuropsychological, and neuroimaging studies is then reviewed in order to assess model predictions. Results from a variety of measurement methods, including task-dissociation and process-estimation methods, are found to lead to remarkably consistent conclusions about the nature of recollection and familiarity, particularly when ceiling effects are avoided. For example, recollection is found to be more sensitive than familiarity to response speeding, division of attention, generation, semantic encoding, the effects of aging, and the amnestic effects of benzodiazepines, but it is less sensitive than familiarity to shifts in response criterion, fluency manipulations, forgetting over short retention intervals, and some perceptual manipulations. Moreover, neuropsychological and neuroimaging results indicate that the two processes rely on partially distinct neural substrates and provide support for models that assume that recollection relies on the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, whereas familiarity relies on regions surrounding the hippocampus. Double dissociations produced by experimental manipulations at time of test indicate that the two processes are independent at retrieval, and single dissociations produced by study manipulations indicate that they are partially independent during encoding. Recollection is similar but not identical to free recall, whereas familiarity is similar to conceptual implicit memory, but is dissociable from perceptual implicit memory. Finally, the results indicate that recollection reflects a thresholdlike retrieval process that supports novel learning, whereas familiarity reflects a signal-detection process that can support novel learning only under certain conditions. The results verify a number of model predictions and prove useful in resolving several theoretical disagreements.",

We studied the neural correlate of gradual decision formation by recording activity from the lateral intraparietal cortex (area LIP) of rhesus monkeys during a combined motion-discrimination reaction-time task. Monkeys reported the direction of random-dot motion by making an eye movement to one of two peripheral choice targets, one of which was within the response field of the neuron. We varied the difficulty of the task and measured both the accuracy of direction discrimination and the time required to reach a decision. Both the accuracy and speed of decisions increased as a function of motion strength. During the period of decision formation, the epoch between onset of visual motion and the initiation of the eye movement response, LIP neurons underwent ramp-like changes in their discharge rate that predicted the monkey's decision. A steeper rise in spike rate was associated with stronger stimulus motion and shorter reaction times. The observations suggest that neurons in LIP integrate time-varying signals that originate in the extrastriate visual cortex, accumulating evidence for or against a specific behavioral response. A threshold level of LIP activity appears to mark the completion of the decision process and to govern the tradeoff between accuracy and speed of perception.",

We further show that existing electrophysiological and modeling data are compatible with the full variety of possible combinations of these components, suggesting that different individuals could use different component combinations. To study variations across subjects, we developed a rat task requiring context-dependent evidence accumulation, and trained many subjects on it. Our task delivers sensory evidence through pulses that have random but precisely known timing, providing high statistical power to characterize each individual’s neural and behavioral responses. Consistent with theoretical predictions, neural and behavioral analysis revealed remarkable heterogeneity across rats, despite uniformly good task performance. The theory further predicts a specific link between behavioral and neural signatures, which was robustly supported in the data. Our results provide a new experimentally-supported theoretical framework to analyze biological and artificial systems performing flexible decision-making tasks, and open the door to the study of individual variability in neural computations underlying higher cognition. \#\#\# Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest.",

Here we propose a theory of systems consolidation in which hippocampal-cortical interactions serve to optimize generalizations that guide future adaptive behavior. We use mathematical analysis of neural network models to characterize fundamental performance tradeoffs in systems consolidation, revealing that memory components should be organized according to their predictability. The theory shows that multiple interacting memory systems can outperform just one, normatively unifying diverse experimental observations and making novel experimental predictions.

However, the distributed nature of neural coding can lead to interference between sensory and memory representations. Here, we show that the brain mitigates such interference by rotating sensory representations into orthogonal memory representations over time. To study how sensory inputs and memories are represented, we recorded neurons from the auditory cortex of mice as they implicitly learned sequences of sounds. We found that the neural population represented sensory inputs and the memory of recent stimuli in two orthogonal dimensions. The transformation of sensory information into a memory was facilitated by a combination of 'stable' neurons, which maintained their selectivity over time, and 'switching' neurons, which inverted their selectivity over time. Together, these neural responses rotated the population representation, transforming sensory inputs into memory. Theoretical modeling showed that this rotational dynamic is an efficient mechanism for generating orthogonal representations, thereby protecting memories from sensory interference.",

We recorded dozens of neurons simultaneously in visual area V4 and found that changes in single neurons accounted for only a small fraction of the improvement in the sensitivity of the population. Instead, over 80\% of the attentional improvement in the population signal was caused by decreases in the correlations between the trial-to-trial fluctuations in the responses of pairs of neurons.

Here we report one step toward the ultimate goal of understanding place cells well enough to predict their fields. Within a theoretical framework in which place fields are derived as a conjunction of external cues with internal grid cell inputs, we predict that even apparently random place cell responses should reflect the structure of their grid inputs and that this structure can be unmasked if probed in sufficiently large neural populations and large environments. To test the theory, we design experiments in long, locally featureless spaces to demonstrate that structured scaffolds undergird place cell responses.

However, recent advances made in freely-moving primates suggest marked differences in spatial representations from rodents, albeit some similarities. Here, we review empirical studies examining the neural correlates of spatial navigation in the primate (including human) hippocampus at the levels of local field potentials and single units. The lower frequency theta oscillations are often intermittent. Single neuron responses are highly mixed and task-dependent. We also discuss neuronal selectivity in the eye and head coordinates.

Within each task, individual neurons had spatially-selective response fields, enabling a linear classifier to decode position in the virtual environment in each task. However, the population code did not generalize across tasks. This was due to sensory and mnemonic coding of non-spatial features and their associations by single neurons during each period of the associative memory task. Thus, sensory and mnemonic representations of non-spatial features shape maps of space in the primate hippocampus during virtual navigation. This may reflect a fundamental role of the hippocampus in compressing information from a variety of sources for efficient memory storage.",

However, perception is subjective and cannot be read out from neural responses; thus, bridging the causal gap between neural activity and perception demands independent characterization of perception. Historically though, the complexity of the perceptual alterations induced by artificial stimulation of IT cortex has rendered them impossible to quantify. Here we addressed this old problem by combining machine learning with high-throughput behavioral optogenetics in macaque monkeys. In closed-loop experiments, we generated complex and highly specific images that the animal could not discriminate from the state of being cortically stimulated. These images, named “perceptograms” for the first time, reveal and depict the contents of the complex hallucinatory percepts induced by local neural perturbation in IT cortex. Furthermore, we found that the nature and magnitude of these hallucinations highly depend on concurrent visual input, stimulation location, and intensity. Objective characterization of stimulation-induced perceptual events opens the door to developing a mechanistic theory of visual perception. Further, it enables us to make better visual prosthetic devices and gain a greater understanding of visual hallucinations in mental disorders. One-Sentence Summary Combining state-of-the-art AI with high-throughput closed-loop brain stimulation experiments, for the first time, we took “pictures” of the complex and subjective visual hallucinations induced by local stimulation in the inferior temporal cortex, a cortical area associated with object recognition. \#\#\# Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest.",

Two weeks after surgery, memory was assessed by presenting each of the 100 object pairs again for a single-choice trial. Normal monkeys exhibited forgetting; that is, they remembered recently learned objects better than objects learned many weeks earlier. Monkeys with hippocampal damage were severely impaired at remembering recently learned objects. In addition, they remembered objects learned long ago as well as normal monkeys did and significantly better than they remembered objects learned recently. These results show that the hippocampal formation is required for memory storage for only a limited period of time after learning.

These dynamics pull memories towards a few stable representations in mnemonic space, inducing a bias in memory representations but reducing the effect of random diffusion. Model-based and model-free analyses of human and monkey behavior show that discrete attractor dynamics account for the distribution, bias, and precision of working memory reports. Furthermore, attractor dynamics are adaptive. They increase in strength as noise increases with memory load and experiments in humans show these dynamics adapt to the statistics of the environment, such that memories drift towards contextually-predicted values.

To determine the principles that underlie this persistent activity, here we combined intracellular and extracellular electrophysiology with optogenetic perturbations and network modelling. We show that during the delay epoch, the activity of ALM neurons moved towards discrete end points that correspond to specific movement directions. These end points were robust to transient shifts in ALM activity caused by optogenetic perturbations. Perturbations occasionally switched the population dynamics to the other end point, followed by incorrect actions.

In our task, participants relocated objects to their remembered locations using a touchscreen. When participants mislocalized objects, their reports were clustered around the locations of other objects in the array, rather than occurring randomly. These 'swap' errors could not be attributed to simple failure to remember either the identity or location of the objects, but rather appeared to arise from failure to bind object identity and location in memory. Moreover, such binding failures significantly contributed to decline in localization performance over retention time. We conclude that when objects are forgotten they do not disappear completely from memory, but rather it is the links between identity and location that are prone to be broken over time.",

  abstract = "Memories serve to establish some permanence to our inner lives despite the fleeting nature of subjective experience. Most neurobiological theories of memory assume that this mental permanence reflects an underlying cellular permanence. Namely, it is assumed that the cellular changes which first occur to store a memory are perpetuated for as long as the memory is stored. But is that really the case? In an opinion piece in this issue of Hippocampus, Aryeh Routtenberg raises the provocative idea that the subjective sense of memory persistence is not in fact a result of persistence at the cellular level, rather, that ``supple synapses'' and multiple ``evanescent networks'' that are forever changing are responsible for our memories. On one level, his proposal could be construed as a radical challenge to some of our most fundamental theories of the neurobiology of memory, including Donald Hebb's proposal that memories are stored by networks that strengthen their connections to increase the likelihood of the same activity patterns being recreated at a later date. However, it could also be seen as a moderating call, a call for a greater acknowledgement of the dynamic, stochastic, and distributed nature of neural networks. In this response to Routtenberg's article, we attempt to provide a clarification of the dividing line between these two interpretations of his argument, and in doing so, we provide some overview of the empirical evidence that bears on this subject. We argue that the data that exists to date favors the more moderate interpretation: that memory storage involves a process in which activity patterns are made more likely to reoccur, but that an under-appreciated reality is that mnemonic traces may continue to change and evolve over time.",

These studies further show that short-term storage mechanisms involve an increase in neural synchrony between prefrontal cortex and posterior cortex and the enhanced activation of long-term memory representations of material held in short-term memory. This activation begins during the encoding/comprehension phase and evidently is prolonged into the retention phase by attentional drive from prefrontal cortex control systems. A parsimonious interpretation of these findings is that the long-term memory systems associated with the posterior cortical processors provide the necessary representational basis for working memory, with the property of short-term memory decay being primarily due to the posterior system. In this view, there is no reason to posit specialized neural systems whose functions are limited to those of short-term storage buffers. Prefrontal cortex provides the attentional pointer system for maintaining activation in the appropriate posterior processing systems. Short-term memory capacity and phenomena such as displacement of information in short-term memory are determined by limitations on the number of pointers that can be sustained by the prefrontal control systems.",

Norris (2017) argued for a prominent class of theories in which STM depends on the brain keeping a separate copy of new information, and against alternatives in which the information is held only in a portion of long-term memory (LTM) that is currently activated (aLTM). Here I question premises of Norris' case for separate-copy theories in the following ways. (a) He did not allow for implications of the common assumption (e.g., Cowan, 1999; Cowan \& Chen, 2009) that aLTM can include new, rapidly formed LTM records of a trial within an STM task. (b) His conclusions from pathological cases of impaired STM along with intact LTM are tenuous; these rare cases can be explained by impairments in encoding, processing, or retrieval related to LTM rather than passive maintenance. (c) Although Norris reasonably allowed structured pointers to aLTM instead of separate copies of the actual item representations in STM, the same structured pointers may well be involved in long-term learning. (d) Last, models of STM storage can serve as the front end of an LTM learning system rather than being separate. I summarize evidence for these premises and an updated version of an alternative theory in which storage depends on aLTM (newly clarified), and, embedded within it, information enhanced by the current focus of attention (Cowan, 1988, 1999), with no need for a separate STM copy.

If true, this would overturn a central tenet of cognitive psychology-the idea that there are functionally and neurobiologically distinct short- and long-term stores. Here I present an updated case for a separation between short- and long-term stores, focusing on the computational demands placed on any STM system. STM must support memory for previously unencountered information, the storage of multiple tokens of the same type, and variable binding. None of these can be achieved simply by activating long-term memory. For example, even a simple sequence of digits such as ``1, 3, 1'' where there are 2 tokens of the digit ``1'' cannot be stored in the correct order simply by activating the representations of the digits ``1'' and ``3'' in LTM. I also review recent neuroimaging data that has been presented as evidence that STM is activated LTM and show that these data are exactly what one would expect to see based on a conventional 2-store view.

Here we recorded single-neuron activities in LPFC while monkeys performed dual tasks that required the simultaneous performance of a varying-load spatial attention task and a spatial memory task. We found that the performance of the monkeys exhibited dual-task interference, and prefrontal neuron activities showed a decreased ability to represent task-relevant information to a degree proportional to the increased demand of the concurrent counterpart task. The locus of the interference was shown to originate in the simultaneous, overloaded recruitment of the same LPFC neural population by the two tasks.

This decrease was significantly accentuated by FC, whereas it was not modified by PC. At each delay, the decrement elicited by FC was as large in DR as in DMS.

In the present experiments, we tested the contributions of the pathway from the FEF to the premotor circuitry in the brain stem that bypasses the SC. We assayed the contribution of the FEF to saccade generation by evoking saccades with direct electrical stimulation of the FEF. To test the role of the SC in conveying information to the brain stem, we inactivated the SC, thereby removing the circuit through the SC to the brain stem, and leaving only the direct FEF-brain stem pathway. If the contributions of the direct pathway were substantial, removal of the SC should have minimal effect on the FEF stimulation, whereas if the FEF stimulation were dependent on the SC, removal of the SC should alter the effect of FEF stimulation. By acutely inactivating the SC, instead of ablating it, we were able to test the efficiency of the direct FEF-brain stem pathway before substantial compensatory mechanisms could mask the effect of removing the SC. We found two striking effects of SC inactivation. In the first, we stimulated the FEF at a site that evoked saccades with vectors that were very close to those evoked at the site of the SC inactivation, and with such optimal alignment, we found that SC inactivation eliminated the saccades evoked by FEF stimulation. The second effect was evident when the FEF evoked saccades were disparate from those evoked in the SC, and in this case we observed a shift in the direction of the evoked saccade that was consistent with the SC inactivation removing a component of a vector average. Together these observations lead to the conclusion that in the nonablated monkey the direct FEF-brain stem pathway is not functionally sufficient to generate accurate saccades in the absence of the indirect pathway that courses from the FEF through the SC to the brain stem circuitry. We suggest that the recovery of function following SC ablation that has been seen in previous studies must result not from the use of an already functioning parallel pathway but from neural plasticity within the saccadic system.",

The framework includes a definition of schema as possessing four necessary and sufficient features, and four additional features schemas are sensitive to, which are not required but do play a frequent and central role in schema functions. Necessary schema features are (1) an associative network structure, (2) basis on multiple episodes, (3) lack of unit detail, and (4) adaptability. Features schemas are sensitive to are (5) chronological relationships, (6) hierarchical organization, (7) cross-connectivity, and (8) embedded response options.

However, these advantageous characteristics of schematic memory may come at the cost of episode-specific information. In the human brain, this tradeoff between general and specific knowledge has been linked to differential contributions of the medial temporal lobes (MTL) to episode-specific memory and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) to generalized, schematic memory. Here, we used a neuropsychological approach to test whether participants with focal vmPFC damage (n = 6) would show a reduced influence of schematic memory relative to healthy normal comparison participants (n = 12) in a recognition task that presented schematically congruent or incongruent contexts at study. As predicted, normal comparison participants were more likely to identify items as old after studying them in congruent contexts, and this effect was reflected in increased true and false recognition. These effects of prior context on recognition were not observed in the vmPFC group, suggesting that vmPFC damage reduced the influence of schematic memory. These findings are consistent with the proposition that the vmPFC plays an important role in integrating previous experience into ongoing memory processes while acting as part of a larger memory network. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: In the human brain, new memories are strongly influenced by existing knowledge of relevant context (sometimes called ``schemas''). Schemas can benefit memory by expediting learning and increasing capacity in familiar contexts, but these benefits may simultaneously reduce episode-specific memory. Here we show that damage to the human ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) reduced the influence of existing knowledge on new memories. Our findings suggest that the vmPFC plays a key role in schematic memory processes by integrating previous experiences and contextual information to influence memory. These findings provide novel insight into the brain regions necessary for normal schematic memory and enhance our understanding of the brain networks supporting memory processes.",

To investigate this shift, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to compare brain activity during paired-associate encoding across three levels of subjective congruency of the association with prior knowledge. Participants indicated how congruent they found an object-scene pair during scanning, and were tested on item and associative recognition memory for these associations one day later. Behaviourally, we found a monotonic increase in memory performance with increasing congruency for both item and associative memory. Moreover, as hypothesised, encoding-related activity in mPFC increased linearly with increasing congruency, whereas MTL showed the opposite pattern of increasing encoding-related activity with decreasing congruency. Additionally, mPFC showed increased functional connectivity with a region in the ventral visual stream, presumably related to the binding of visual representations. These results support predictions made by a recent neuroscientific framework concerning the effects of schema on memory. Specifically, our findings show that enhanced memory for more congruent information is mediated by the mPFC, which is hypothesised to guide integration of new information into a pre-existing schema represented in cortical areas, while memory for more incongruent information relies instead on automatic encoding of arbitrary associations by the MTL.",

We recorded neurons in area V4 as monkeys performed an attention-demanding task. We find that the distribution of action potential durations is strongly bimodal. Neurons with narrow action potentials have higher firing rates and larger attention-dependent increases in absolute firing rate than neurons with broad action potentials. The percentage increase in response is similar across the two classes. We also find evidence that attention increases the reliability of the neuronal response. This modulation is more than two-fold stronger among putative interneurons. These findings lead to the surprising conclusion that the strongest attentional modulation occurs among local interneurons that do not transmit signals between areas.",

The present study used functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine this question. Ten young adults were scanned while they recognized items from early or late serial positions. Recognition of early items uniquely activated brain areas traditionally associated with LTM, namely, regions within the hippocampal memory system. None of these areas was activated for retrieval of late items. These results indicate differential use of LTM retrieval processes, and therefore support dual-store models over single-store models.",

However, it remains unknown how such memory is utilized during the short-term maintenance of information. Specifically, if people have a previously encoded memory for an item, how does this affect subsequent working memory for that same item? Here, we demonstrate people can quickly and accurately make use of visual long-term memories and therefore maintain less perceptual information actively in working memory. We assessed how much perceptual information is actively maintained in working memory by measuring neural activity during the delay period of a working memory task using electroencephalography. We find that despite maintaining less perceptual information in working memory when long-term memory representations are available, there is no decrement in memory performance. This suggests under certain circumstances people can dynamically disengage working memory maintenance and instead use long-term memories when available. However, this does not mean participants always utilize long-term memory. In a follow-up experiment, we introduced additional perceptual interference into working memory and found participants actively maintained items in working memory even when they had existing long-term memories available. These results clarify the kinds of conditions under which long-term and working memory operate. Specifically, working memory is engaged when new information is encountered or perceptual interference is high. Visual long-term memory may otherwise be rapidly accessed and utilized in lieu of active perceptual maintenance. These data demonstrate the interactions between working memory and long-term memory are more dynamic and fluid than previously thought.",

In addition to sequential neural dynamics and strong interneuronal interactions, we found that the hidden state - monkey's displacement from the goal - was encoded in single neurons, and could be dynamically decoded from population activity. The decoded estimates predicted navigation performance on individual trials. Task manipulations that perturbed the world model induced substantial changes in neural interactions, and modified the neural representation of the hidden state, while representations of sensory and motor variables remained stable. The findings were recapitulated by a task-optimized recurrent neural network model, suggesting that task demands shape the neural interactions in PPC, leading them to embody a world model that consolidates information and tracks task-relevant hidden states.",

Further, the activity driven by a particular combination of objects was not a simple addition of the activity elicited by individual objects. Instead, the representation of the first object was altered by the addition of the second object to memory, and the form of this change was not systematically predictable. These results indicate that multiple objects are not stored in separate groups of prefrontal neurons. Rather, they are represented by a single population of neurons in a complex fashion. We also found that the strength of the memory trace associated with each object decayed over time, leading to a relatively stronger representation of more recently seen objects. This is a potential mechanism for representing the temporal order of objects.",

However, the causal role of LIP remains controversial. In this study, we used pharmacological and chemogenetic methods to inactivate LIP in one brain hemisphere of four rhesus monkeys.

  abstract = "Inferior temporal (IT) cortex of primates is known to play an important role in visual memory. Previous studies of IT neurons during performance of working memory tasks have found modulation of responses when a current stimulus matched an item in memory; however, this effect was lost if other stimuli intervened in the retention interval. To examine how IT cortex retains memories while new stimuli are activating the cells, we recorded from IT neurons while monkeys performed a delayed matching-to-sample task, with multiple intervening items between the sample and matching test stimulus. About half of the cells responded differently to a test stimulus if it matched the sample, and this difference was maintained following intervening stimuli. For most of the affected cells, the responses to matching stimuli were suppressed; however, for a few cells the opposite effect was seen. Temporal contiguity alone could not explain the results, as there was no modulation of responses when a stimulus on one trial was repeated on the next trial. Thus, an active reset mechanism appears to restrict the memory comparison to just the stimuli presented within a trial. The suppressive effects appear to be generated within or before IT cortex since the suppression of response to matching stimuli began almost immediately with the onset of the visual response. The memory of the sample stimulus affected not only the responses to matching stimuli but also those to nonmatching stimuli. There was suggestive evidence that the more similar a nonmatching stimulus to the sample, the more the response was suppressed. About a quarter of the cells showed stimulus-selective activity in the delay interval following the sample. However, this activity appeared to be eliminated by intervening stimuli. Thus, it is unlikely that delay-interval activity in IT contributed to the performance of this particular version of delayed matching to sample. To determine how much information about the match-nonmatch status of the stimulus was conveyed by individual neurons, we analyzed the responses with discriminant analysis. The responses of an individual IT neuron could be used to classify a stimulus as matching or nonmatching on about 60\% of the trials. To achieve the same performance as the animal would require averaging the responses of a minimum of 25 IT neurons. There was no evidence that mnemonic information was carried by temporal variations in the spike trains. By contrast, there was a modest amount of temporal variation in sensory responses to different visual stimuli.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

Here we propose the novel concept of spatial computing where beta and gamma interactions cause item-specific activity to flow spatially across the network during a task. This way, control-related information such as item order is stored in the spatial activity independent of the detailed recurrent connectivity supporting the item-specific activity itself. The spatial flow is in turn reflected in low-dimensional activity shared by many neurons. We verify these predictions by analyzing local field potentials and neuronal spiking. We hypothesize that spatial computing can facilitate generalization and zero-shot learning by utilizing spatial component as an additional information encoding dimension.",

These inter-effector regions exhibit decreased cortical thickness and strong functional connectivity to each other, as well as to the cingulo-opercular network (CON), critical for action5 and physiological control6, arousal7, errors8 and pain9. This interdigitation of action control-linked and motor effector regions was verified in the three largest fMRI datasets. Macaque and pediatric (newborn, infant and child) precision fMRI suggested cross-species homologues and developmental precursors of the inter-effector system. A battery of motor and action fMRI tasks documented concentric effector somatotopies, separated by the CON-linked inter-effector regions. The inter-effectors lacked movement specificity and co-activated during action planning (coordination of hands and feet) and axial body movement (such as of the abdomen or eyebrows). These results, together with previous studies demonstrating stimulation-evoked complex actions4 and connectivity to internal organs10 such as the adrenal medulla, suggest that M1 is punctuated by a system for whole-body action planning, the somato-cognitive action network (SCAN). In M1, two parallel systems intertwine, forming an integrate–isolate pattern: effector-specific regions (foot, hand and mouth) for isolating fine motor control and the SCAN for integrating goals, physiology and body movement.",

However, it has been difficult to ascertain the degree to which the two structures are dependent on each other or interact in subserving these cognitive functions. To investigate this question directly, we prepared two group of monkeys. First, the contralateral frontal-hippocampal split group (CFHS) received a unilateral lesion of the hippocampus and surrounding posterior parahippocampal cortices (H +), combined with a contralateral lesion of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) plus transection of the corpus callosum and anterior commissure. This preparation functionally ``disconnects'' the remaining intact H + from the sole intact DLPFC in the opposite hemisphere. As a surgical control group, a second set of animals, the ipsilateral frontal-hippocampal split group, was prepared with a unilateral lesion of the DLPFC and an ipsilateral H + lesion together plus transection of the corpus callosum and anterior commissure. This preparation matches the locus and extent of damage in the cross-lesion group but allows the intact H + and intact DLPFC to interact ipsilaterally. Following recovery from surgery, all animals were then tested on the delayed nonmatching to sample task (DNMS), a test of recognition memory. The crossed-lesion split-brain group (CFHS) was markedly impaired on DNMS in both acquisition (rule learning) and performance over delays (recognition memory).

The primate prefrontal cortex (PFC) is a primary focus of inquiry in this regard, as under different conditions, PFC can encode information with geometries that either rely on past experience[7][3]–[13][4] or are experience agnostic[3][5],[14][6]–[16][7]. One hypothesis is that PFC representations should evolve with learning[4][8],[17][9],[18][10], from a format that supports exploration of all possible task rules to a format that minimises metabolic cost[4][8],[17][9],[18][10] and supports generalisation[7][3],[8][11]. Here we test this idea by recording neural activity from PFC when learning a new rule (‘XOR rule’) from scratch. We show that PFC representations progress from being high dimensional and randomly mixed to low dimensional and rule selective, consistent with predictions from metabolically constrained optimised neural networks. We also find that this low-dimensional representation facilitates generalisation of the XOR rule to a new stimulus set. These results show that previously conflicting accounts of PFC representations can be reconciled by considering the adaptation of these representations across learning in the service of metabolic efficiency and generalisation. \#\#\# Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest.

  abstract = "Prefrontal neurons exhibit saccade-related activity and pre-saccadic memory-related activity often encodes the directions of forthcoming eye movements, in line with demonstrated prefrontal contribution to flexible control of voluntary eye movements. However, many prefrontal neurons exhibit post-saccadic activity that is initiated well after the initiation of eye movement. Although post-saccadic activity has been observed in the frontal eye field, this activity is thought to be a corollary discharge from oculomotor centers, because this activity shows no directional tuning and is observed whenever the monkeys perform eye movements regardless of goal-directed or not. However, prefrontal post-saccadic activities exhibit directional tunings similar as pre-saccadic activities and show context dependency, such that post-saccadic activity is observed only when monkeys perform goal-directed saccades. Context-dependency of prefrontal post-saccadic activity suggests that this activity is not a result of corollary signals from oculomotor centers, but contributes to other functions of the prefrontal cortex. One function might be the termination of memory-related activity after a behavioral response is done. This is supported by the observation that the termination of memory-related activity coincides with the initiation of post-saccadic activity in population analyses of prefrontal activities. The termination of memory-related activity at the end of the trial ensures that the subjects can prepare to receive new and updated information. Another function might be the monitoring of behavioral performance, since the termination of memory-related activity by post-saccadic activity could be associated with informing the correctness of the response and the termination of the trial. However, further studies are needed to examine the characteristics of saccade-related activities in the prefrontal cortex and their functions in eye movement control and a variety of cognitive functions.",

To address this, we densely mapped the cortical connectome of LPFC, using electrical microstimulation combined with functional MRI (EM-fMRI). We found isomorphic mappings between LPFC and five major processing domains composing most of the cerebral cortex except early sensory and motor areas. An LPFC grid of ∼200 stimulation sites topographically mapped to separate grids of activation sites in the five domains, coarsely resembling how the visual cortex maps the retina. The temporal and parietal maps largely overlapped in LPFC, suggesting topographically organized convergence of the ventral and dorsal streams, and the other maps overlapped at least partially. Thus, the LPFC contains overlapping, millimeter-scale maps that mirror the organization of major cortical processing domains, supporting LPFC's role in coordinating activity within and across these domains.",

However, these theories are divided by the roles they attribute to the DG during learning and recall and by the contributions they ascribe to specific inputs or cell types within the DG. These differences influence the information that the DG is thought to impart to downstream structures. We work towards a holistic view of the role of DG in learning and memory by first developing three critical questions to foster a dialogue between the leading theories. We then evaluate the extent to which previous studies address our questions, highlight remaining areas of conflict, and suggest future experiments to bridge these theories.",

Previous studies have suggested that when multiple stimuli fall within a cell's receptive field, they compete for the cell's response in a manner that can be biased in favor of attended stimuli. In the present study we examined this role of attention in areas V1, V2, and V4 of macaque monkeys with the use of a behavioral paradigm in which attention was directed to one of two stimulus locations. When two stimuli were presented simultaneously inside the cell's receptive field (which could be accomplished only in areas V2 and V4), we found that the cell's response was strongly influenced by which of the two stimuli was attended. The size of this attention effect was reduced when the attended and ignored stimuli were presented sequentially rather than simultaneously. In addition, the effects became very weak and inconsistent in these areas when only one of the two stimuli was located inside the receptive field. Attention thus modulated sensory responses primarily when two or more simultaneous stimuli competed for access to a neuron's receptive field. As in areas V2 and V4, attention did not modulate sensory responses in area V1 when only a single stimulus was inside the receptive field. In addition, the small receptive fields in this area precluded the simultaneous presentation of attended and ignored stimuli inside the receptive field, making it impossible to determine whether attention effects would be observed under the conditions that led to consistent attention effects in areas V2 and V4. Spontaneous firing rates in areas V2 and V4 were found to be 30-40\% higher when attention was directed inside rather than outside the receptive field, even when no stimulus was present in the receptive field. Spontaneous firing rates also varied according to the particular location within the receptive field that was attended. These shifts in spontaneous activity may reflect a top-down signal that biases responses in favor of stimuli at the attended location.",

Here we test whether neurons in inferior temporal cortex, an area known to be important for high-level visual processing, might provide these components. Monkeys were presented with a complex picture (the cue) to hold in memory during a delay period. The cue initiated activity that persisted through the delay among the neurons that were tuned to its features. The monkeys were then given 2-5 choice pictures and were required to make an eye movement to the one (the target) that matched the cue.

The first study examined which attentional functions are critically dependent on PFC by removing PFC unilaterally and transecting the forebrain commissures in two macaques. The monkeys fixated a central cue and discriminated the orientation of a colored target grating presented among colored distracter gratings in either the hemifield affected by the PFC lesion or the normal control hemifield. When the cue was held constant for many trials, task performance in the affected hemifield was nearly normal. However, performance was severely impaired when the cue was switched frequently across trials. The monkeys were unimpaired in a pop-out task with changing targets that did not require top-down attentional control. Thus, the PFC lesion resulted in selective impairment in the monkeys' ability to switch top-down control. In the second study, we used fMRI to investigate the neural correlates of top-down control in humans performing tasks identical to those used in the monkey experiments. Several fronto-parietal and posterior visual areas showed enhanced activation when attention was switched, which was greater on color cueing (top-down) trials relative to pop-out trials. Taken together, our findings indicate that both frontal and parietal cortices are involved in generating top-down control signals for attentive switching, which may then be fed back to visual processing areas. The PFC in particular plays a critical role in the ability to switch attentional control on the basis of changing task demands.",

The responses of cells in both areas were modulated by feature attention, independent of spatial attention, and the magnitude of response enhancement was inversely correlated with the number of saccades needed to find the target. However, an analysis of the latency of sensory and attentional influences on responses suggested that V4 provides bottom-up sensory information about stimulus features, whereas the FEF provides a top-down attentional bias toward target features that modulates sensory processing in V4 and that could be used to guide the eyes to a searched-for target.",

Information about the target location was present in activity as early as 140ms after array onset.

Unilateral neurotoxic lesions of ventrolateral prefrontal cortex produced by multiple injections of a mixture of ibotenate and N-methyl-D-aspartate did not affect performance. However, when disconnection from inferotemporal cortex was completed by ablating this region contralateral to the neurotoxic prefrontal lesion, new learning was substantially impaired. Sham disconnection (injecting saline instead of neurotoxin contralateral to the inferotemporal lesion) did not affect performance. These findings support two conclusions: first, that the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex is a critical area within the frontal lobe for scene memory; and second, the effects of ablations of prefrontal cortex can be confidently attributed to the loss of cell bodies within the prefrontal cortex rather than to interruption of fibres of passage through the lesioned area.",

The loss or sparing of certain performance abilities has been shown to be attributable to differences in the specific requirements of behavioral testing (e.g., spatial vs. non-spatial memoranda) along with differences in the specific locations of applied ablations (e.g., dorsal vs. ventral prefrontal cortex). Such findings, which have accumulated now for over a century, have led to widespread acceptance that the dorsolateral and ventrolateral aspects of the prefrontal cortex may perform different, specialized roles in higher order cognition. Nonetheless, it remains unclear and controversial how the lateral prefrontal cortex is functionally organized. Two main views propose different types of functional specialization of the dorsal and ventral prefrontal cortex. The first contends that the lateral prefrontal cortex is segregated according to the processing of spatial and nonspatial domains of information. The second contends that domain specialization is not the key to the organization of the prefrontal cortex, but that instead, the dorsal and ventral prefrontal cortices perform qualitatively different operations. This report critically reviews all relevant monkey lesion studies that have served as the foundation for current theories regarding the functional organization of the prefrontal cortex. Our goals are to evaluate how well the existing lesion data support each theory and to enumerate caveats that must be considered when interpreting the relevant literature.",

However, less agreement exists on the issue of functional segregation within different subregions of the PFC with regard to the domains of spatial and nonspatial processing or involvement in simpler versus more complex aspects of WM, e.g., maintenance versus processing function. To address these issues, six monkeys were trained to perform four WM tasks that differed with respect to domain (spatial vs nonspatial) and level of WM demand (recall of one vs three items). The delayed response format was used to assess simple one-item memory, whereas self-ordering tasks were used to require the monkey to maintain and organize three items of information within WM. After training, the monkeys received bilateral PFC lesions in one of two different areas, Walker's areas 9 and 8B (dorsomedial convexity; n = 3) or areas 46 and 8A (dorsolateral cortex, n = 3) and then tested postoperatively on all tasks. Monkeys with lesions of the dorsomedial convexity were not impaired either on spatial or nonspatial WM tasks, whether the task required simple storage or sequential processing. By contrast, lesions of the dorsolateral cortex produced a significant and persistent impairment in both simple and complex spatial WM but no impairment in the two nonspatial WM tasks. These results support a functional segregation within the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex for WM: the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (area 46/8A) is selectively involved in spatial WM, whereas the dorsomedial convexity (area 9/8B) is not critically engaged in either spatial or nonspatial working memory. Furthermore, the specific involvement of area 46/8A in spatial sequencing as well as in single-item storage WM tasks supports, in the nonhuman primate, an areal dissociation based on domain rather than on processing demand.",

There are, however, a number of phenomena that are not readily captured by the original model. These are outlined here and a fourth component to the model, the episodic buffer, is proposed. It comprises a limited capacity system that provides temporary storage of information held in a multimodal code, which is capable of binding information from the subsidiary systems, and from long-term memory, into a unitary episodic representation. Conscious awareness is assumed to be the principal mode of retrieval from the buffer. The revised model differs from the old principally in focussing attention on the processes of integrating information, rather than on the isolation of the subsystems. In doing so, it provides a better basis for tackling the more complex aspects of executive control in working memory.",

  abstract = "The prefrontal cortex participates in a variety of higher cognitive functions. The concept of working memory is now widely used to understand prefrontal functions. Neurophysiological studies have revealed that stimulus-selective delay-period activity is a neural correlate of the mechanism for temporarily maintaining information in working memory processes. The central executive, which is the master component of Baddeley's working memory model and is thought to be a function of the prefrontal cortex, controls the performance of other components by allocating a limited capacity of memory resource to each component based on its demand. Recent neurophysiological studies have attempted to reveal how prefrontal neurons achieve the functions of the central executive. For example, the neural mechanisms of memory control have been examined using the interference effect in a dual-task paradigm. It has been shown that this interference effect is caused by the competitive and overloaded recruitment of overlapping neural populations in the prefrontal cortex by two concurrent tasks and that the information-processing capacity of a single neuron is limited to a fixed level, can be flexibly allocated or reallocated between two concurrent tasks based on their needs, and enhances behavioral performance when its allocation to one task is increased. Further, a metamemory task requiring spatial information has been used to understand the neural mechanism for monitoring its own operations, and it has been shown that monitoring the quality of spatial information represented by prefrontal activity is an important factor in the subject's choice and that the strength of spatially selective delay-period activity reflects confidence in decision-making. Although further studies are needed to elucidate how the prefrontal cortex controls memory resource and supervises other systems, some important mechanisms related to the central executive have been identified.",

The chapter presents a series of experiments on the role of memory in reasoning, language comprehension, and learning. An attempt is made to apply the comparable techniques in all three cases to allow a common pattern to emerge, if the same working memory system is operative in all three instances. The chapter makes a case for postulating the working memory-LTS system as a modification of the current STS-LTS view. Working memory represents a control system with limits on both its storage and processing capabilities, and has access to phonemically coded information (possibly by controlling a rehearsal buffer), that it is responsible for the limited memory span, but does not underlie the recency effect in free recall. The experiments presented in the chapter suggest that the phonemic rehearsal buffer plays a limited role in this process, but is by no means essential. These experiments also suggest that working memory plays a part in verbal reasoning and in prose comprehension. Understanding the detailed role of working memory in these tasks, however, must proceed hand-in-hand with an understanding of the tasks themselves.",

Thus, although observers can remember thousands of images, it is widely assumed that these memories lack detail. Contrary to this assumption, here we show that long-term memory is capable of storing a massive number of objects with details from the image. Participants viewed pictures of 2,500 objects over the course of 5.5 h. Afterward, they were shown pairs of images and indicated which of the two they had seen. The previously viewed item could be paired with either an object from a novel category, an object of the same basic-level category, or the same object in a different state or pose. Performance in each of these conditions was remarkably high (92\%, 88\%, and 87\%, respectively), suggesting that participants successfully maintained detailed representations of thousands of images. These results have implications for cognitive models, in which capacity limitations impose a primary computational constraint (e.g., models of object recognition), and pose a challenge to neural models of memory storage and retrieval, which must be able to account for such a large and detailed storage capacity.",

Observers were shown real-world objects in random colors and were asked to recall the colors after a delay. We quantified two parameters of performance: the variability of internal representations of color (fidelity) and the probability of forgetting an object's color altogether. Surprisingly, the fidelity of color information in long-term memory was comparable to the asymptotic precision of working memory. These results suggest that long-term memory and working memory may be constrained by a common limit, such as a bound on the fidelity required to retrieve a memory representation.",

We trained monkeys to classify 360 degrees of visual motion directions into two discrete categories, and compared neuronal activity in the lateral intraparietal (LIP) and middle temporal (MT) areas, two interconnected brain regions known to be involved in visual motion processing. Here we show that neurons in LIP--an area known to be centrally involved in visuo-spatial attention, motor planning and decision-making-robustly reflect the category of motion direction as a result of learning. The activity of LIP neurons encoded directions of motion according to their category membership, and that encoding shifted after the monkeys were retrained to group the same stimuli into two new categories. In contrast, neurons in area MT were strongly direction selective but carried little, if any, explicit category information. This indicates that LIP might be an important nexus for the transformation of visual direction selectivity to more abstract representations that encode the behavioural relevance, or meaning, of stimuli.",

However, that number was meant more as a rough estimate and a rhetorical device than as a real capacity limit. Others have since suggested that there is a more precise capacity limit, but that it is only three to five chunks. The present target article brings together a wide variety of data on capacity limits suggesting that the smaller capacity limit is real. Capacity limits will be useful in analyses of information processing only if the boundary conditions for observing them can be carefully described. Four basic conditions in which chunks can be identified and capacity limits can accordingly be observed are: (1) when information overload limits chunks to individual stimulus items, (2) when other steps are taken specifically to block the recording of stimulus items into larger chunks, (3) in performance discontinuities caused by the capacity limit, and (4) in various indirect effects of the capacity limit. Under these conditions, rehearsal and long-term memory cannot be used to combine stimulus items into chunks of an unknown size; nor can storage mechanisms that are not capacity-limited, such as sensory memory, allow the capacity-limited storage mechanism to be refilled during recall. A single, central capacity limit averaging about four chunks is implicated along with other, noncapacity-limited sources. The pure STM capacity limit expressed in chunks is distinguished from compound STM limits obtained when the number of separately held chunks is unclear. Reasons why pure capacity estimates fall within a narrow range are discussed and a capacity limit for the focus of attention is proposed.",

Activation is assumed to decay spontaneously with the passage of time, so a refreshing process-rehearsal-is needed to maintain availability. Most of the phenomena of immediate retention, such as capacity limitations and word length effects, are assumed to arise from trade-offs between rehearsal and decay. This ``standard model'' of how we remember over the short-term still enjoys considerable popularity, although recent research questions most of its main assumptions. In this chapter I review the recent research and identify the empirical and conceptual problems that plague traditional conceptions of short-term memory. Increasingly, researchers are recognizing that short-term retention is cue driven, much like long-term memory, and that neither rehearsal nor decay is likely to explain the particulars of short-term forgetting.",

Similar gains in memory were found for items of central and marginal interest. No loss of memory was found for picture detail over a 60-s interval, even when observers performed a VSTM or reading task during the delay.

Information about simple stimuli-colors and orientations-is encoded into working memory rapidly: In under 100 ms, working memory ‟fills up,`` revealing a stark capacity limit. However, for real-world objects, the same behavioral limits do not hold: With increasing encoding time, people store more real-world objects and do so with more detail. This boost in performance for real-world objects is generally assumed to reflect the use of a separate episodic long-term memory system, rather than working memory. Here we show that this behavioral increase in capacity with real-world objects is not solely due to the use of separate episodic long-term memory systems. In particular, we show that this increase is a result of active storage in working memory, as shown by directly measuring neural activity during the delay period of a working memory task using EEG. These data challenge fixed-capacity working memory models and demonstrate that working memory and its capacity limitations are dependent upon our existing knowledge.",

To be useful for planning, difficulty judgments should not require completion of the task. Here we examine the processes underlying difficulty judgments in a perceptual decision making task. Participants viewed two patches of dynamic random dots, which were colored blue or yellow stochastically on each appearance. Stimulus coherence (the probability, p blue , of a dot being blue) varied across trials and patches thus establishing difficulty, ( p blue - 0.5|. Participants were asked to indicate for which patch it would be easier to decide the dominant color. Accuracy in difficulty decisions improved with the difference in the stimulus difficulties, whereas the reaction times were not determined solely by this quantity. For example, when the patches shared the same difficulty, reaction times were shorter for easier stimuli. A comparison of several models of difficulty judgment suggested that participants compare the absolute accumulated evidence from each stimulus and terminate their decision when they differed by a set amount. The model predicts that when the dominant color of each stimulus is known, reaction times should depend only on the difference in difficulty, which we confirm empirically. We also show that this model is preferred to one that compares the confidence one would have in making each decision. The results extend evidence accumulation models, used to explain choice, reaction time and confidence to prospective judgments of difficulty.",

Important support for the model has been the observation that it fits experimental data well. The continuous dual process (CDP) model also fits experimental data well. However, this model does not provide quantitative estimates of recollection and familiarity, making it less immediately useful for illuminating the functional neuroanatomy of recognition memory. These two models are incompatible and cannot both be correct, and an alternative method of model comparison is needed. We tested for systematic errors in each model's ability to fit recognition memory data from four independent data sets from three different laboratories.

This short-latency preference in SC depends on signals routed through early visual cortex, because inactivating the lateral geniculate nucleus, the key relay from retina to cortex, virtually eliminates visual responses in SC, including face-related activity.

Although theta/gamma coupling in rodent CA1 occurs during exploration and sharp-wave ripples emerge in quiescence, it is less clear that these oscillatory regimes extend to primates. We therefore sought to identify correspondences in frequency bands, nesting, and behavioral coupling of oscillations taken from macaque hippocampus. We found that, in contrast to rodent oscillations, theta and gamma frequency bands in macaque CA1 were segregated by behavioral states. In both stationary and freely moving designs, beta2/gamma (15-70 Hz) had greater power during visual search whereas the theta band (3-10 Hz; peak ~8 Hz) dominated during quiescence and early sleep. Moreover, theta-band amplitude was strongest when beta2/slow gamma (20-35 Hz) amplitude was weakest, instead occurring along with higher frequencies (60-150 Hz). Spike-field coherence was most frequently seen in these three bands (3-10 Hz, 20-35 Hz, and 60-150 Hz); however, the theta-band coherence was largely due to spurious coupling during sharp-wave ripples. Accordingly, no intrinsic theta spiking rhythmicity was apparent. These results support a role for beta2/slow gamma modulation in CA1 during active exploration in the primate that is decoupled from theta oscillations. The apparent difference to the rodent oscillatory canon calls for a shift in focus of frequency when considering the primate hippocampus.",

We investigated whether changing the probability that a visual stimulus would be selected as the target for a saccade altered activity of monkey superior colliculus (SC) neurons in two experiments. First, we changed the number of possible targets on each trial. Second, we kept the visual display constant and presented a single saccade target repeatedly so that target probability was established over time. Buildup neurons in the SC, those with delay period activity, showed a consistent reduction in activity as the probability of the saccade decreased, independent of the visual stimulus configuration. Other SC neurons, fixation and burst, were largely unaffected by the changes in saccade target probability. Because we had monkeys making saccades to many locations within the visual field, we could examine activity associated with saccades outside of the movement field of neurons. We found the activity of buildup neurons to be similar across the SC, before the target was identified, and reduced when the number of possible targets increased. The results of our experiments are consistent with a role for this activity in establishing a motor set. We found, consistent with this interpretation, that the activity of these neurons was predictive of the latency of a saccadic eye movement and not other saccade parameters such as end point or peak velocity.",

This includes the frontal eye field (FEF) where nearly half of the neurons are active when spatial locations are held in working memory. Past evidence has established the FEF’s contribution to the planning and triggering of saccadic eye movements as well as to the control of visual spatial attention. However, it remains unclear if persistent delay activity reflects a similar dual role in movement planning and visuospatial working memory. We trained monkeys to alternate between different forms of a spatial working memory task which could dissociate remembered stimulus locations from planned eye movements. We tested the effects of inactivation of FEF sites on behavioral performance in the different tasks. Consistent with previous studies, FEF inactivation impaired the execution of memory-guided saccades, and impaired performance when remembered locations matched the planned eye movement. In contrast, memory performance was largely unaffected when the remembered location was dissociated from the correct eye movement response. Overall, the inactivation effects demonstrated clear deficits on eye movements, regardless of task type, but little or no evidence of a deficit in spatial working memory. Thus, our results indicate that persistent delay activity in the FEF contributes primarily to the preparation of eye movements and not to spatial working memory. \#\#\# Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest.",

Second, a neural code is information only by reference to something with a known meaning, which is not the kind of information relevant for a perceptual system. Third, the causal structure of neural codes (linear, atemporal) is incongruent with the causal structure of the brain (circular, dynamic). I conclude that a causal description of the brain cannot be based on neural codes, because spikes are more like actions than hieroglyphs.Long abstract “Neural coding” is a popular metaphor in neuroscience, where objective properties of the world are communicated to the brain in the form of spikes. Here I argue that this metaphor is often inappropriate and misleading. First, when neurons are said to encode experimental parameters, the neural code depends on experimental details that are not carried by the coding variable. Thus, the representational power of neural codes is much more limited than generally implied. Second, neural codes carry information only by reference to things with known meaning. In contrast, perceptual systems must build information from relations between sensory signals and actions, forming a structured internal model. Neural codes are inadequate for this purpose because they are unstructured. Third, coding variables are observables tied to the temporality of experiments, while spikes are timed actions that mediate coupling in a distributed dynamical system. The coding metaphor tries to fit the dynamic, circular and distributed causal structure of the brain into a linear chain of transformations between observables, but the two causal structures are incongruent. I conclude that the neural coding metaphor cannot provide a basis for theories of brain function, because it is incompatible with both the causal structure of the brain and the informational requirements of cognition.",

However, the interpretation of their results requires care. Decoding models can help reveal whether particular information is present in a brain region in a format the decoder can exploit. Encoding models make comprehensive predictions about representational spaces. In the context of sensory experiments, where stimuli are experimentally controlled, encoding models enable us to test and compare brain-computational theories. Encoding and decoding models typically include fitted linear-model components. Sometimes the weights of the fitted linear combinations are interpreted as reflecting, in an encoding model, the contribution of different sensory features to the representation or, in a decoding model, the contribution of different measured brain responses to a decoded feature. Such interpretations can be problematic when the predictor variables or their noise components are correlated and when priors (or penalties) are used to regularize the fit. Encoding and decoding models are evaluated in terms of their generalization performance. The correct interpretation depends on the level of generalization a model achieves (e.g. to new response measurements for the same stimuli, to new stimuli from the same population, or to stimuli from a different population). Significant decoding or encoding performance of a single model (at whatever level of generality) does not provide strong constraints for theory.

Central to this capacity is the ability to form high-level, abstract representations that take advantage of regularities in the world to support generalization1. However, little is known about how these representations are encoded in populations of neurons, how they emerge through learning and how they relate to behaviour2,3. Here we characterized the representational geometry of populations of neurons (single units) recorded in the hippocampus, amygdala, medial frontal cortex and ventral temporal cortex of neurosurgical patients performing an inferential reasoning task. We found that only the neural representations formed in the hippocampus simultaneously encode several task variables in an abstract, or disentangled, format. This representational geometry is uniquely observed after patients learn to perform inference, and consists of disentangled directly observable and discovered latent task variables. Learning to perform inference by trial and error or through verbal instructions led to the formation of hippocampal representations with similar geometric properties. The observed relation between representational format and inference behaviour suggests that abstract and disentangled representational geometries are important for complex cognition.",

When monkeys report more confidence in a perceptual decision, that decision is more likely to be correct. It is not known how neural circuits in the primate brain assess the quality of perceptual decisions. Here, we test two hypotheses. First, that decision confidence is related to the structure of population activity in sensory cortex. And second, that this relation differs from the one between sensory activity and decision content. We trained macaque monkeys to judge the orientation of ambiguous stimuli and additionally report their confidence in these judgments. We recorded population activity in the primary visual cortex and used decoders to expose the relationship between this activity and the choice-confidence reports. Our analysis validated both hypotheses and suggests that perceptual decisions arise from a neural computation downstream of visual cortex that estimates the most likely interpretation of a sensory response, while decision confidence instead reflects a computation that evaluates whether this sensory response will produce a reliable decision. Our work establishes a direct link between neural population activity in sensory cortex and the metacognitive ability to introspect about the quality of perceptual decisions.",

The RPE-based interpretation of dopamine signaling is, in its original form, probably too simple and fails to explain all the properties of phasic dopamine observed in behaving animals. This Perspective helps to resolve some of the conflicting interpretations of dopamine that currently exist in the literature. We focus on the following three empirical challenges to the RPE theory of dopamine: why does dopamine (1) ramp up as animals approach rewards, (2) respond to sensory and motor features and (3) influence action selection? We argue that the prediction error concept, once it has been suitably modified and generalized based on an analysis of each computational problem, answers each challenge. Nonetheless, there are a number of additional empirical findings that appear to demand fundamentally different theoretical explanations beyond encoding RPE. Therefore, looking forward, we discuss the prospects for a unifying theory that respects the diversity of dopamine signaling and function as well as the complex circuitry that both underlies and responds to dopaminergic transmission.",

The monkeys' behavior was largely contrast invariant, contrary to the predictions of an RS-inspired decoder, which could not distinguish responses to images that are repeated from those that are of lower contrast. However, the monkeys' behavioral patterns were well predicted by a linearly decodable variant in which the total spike count was corrected for contrast modulation.

Here, we emphasize that short-term retention of information typically involves an interplay between WM and long-term memory (LTM), especially when task demands or interruptions divert our focus from remembered items. We suggest that active neural representation may distinguish between “online” representations in WM and “offline” representations in LTM. This perspective is at odds with “activity-silent” models of WM, which hold that WM representations can be sustained without persistent neural activity. We suggest that activity-silent representations might be more productively conceptualized as offline representations in LTM because accessing these representations shows multiple signatures of retrieval from LTM. Moreover, active neural traces track WM load, predict individual differences in performance, and respect sharp item limits in WM storage. Thus, we argue that using neural activity as an operational definition of WM may provide strong traction for studying the dynamic collaboration between WM and LTM that is critical for intelligent behavior.",

We hypothesize that the need for efficient compression shapes biological systems in many of the same ways that it shapes engineered systems. If true, then the tools that engineers use to analyze and design systems, namely rate-distortion theory (RDT), can profitably be used to understand human perception and memory. The first portion of this article discusses how three general principles for efficient data compression provide accounts for many important behavioral phenomena and experimental results. We also discuss how these principles are embodied in RDT. The second portion notes that exact RDT methods are computationally feasible only in low-dimensional stimulus spaces. To date, researchers have used deep neural networks to approximately implement RDT in high-dimensional spaces, but these implementations have been limited to tasks in which the sole goal is compression with respect to reconstruction error. Here, we introduce a new deep neural network architecture that approximately implements RDT. An important property of our architecture is that it is trained ``end-to-end,'' operating on raw perceptual input (e.g., pixel values) rather than intermediate levels of abstraction, as is the case with most psychological models. The article's final portion conjectures on how efficient compression can occur in memory over time, thereby providing motivations for multiple memory systems operating at different time scales, and on how efficient compression may explain some attentional phenomena such as RTs in visual search.

We present a probabilistic model of change detection that attempts to bridge this gap by formalizing the role of perceptual organization and allowing for richer, more structured memory representations. Using either standard visual working memory displays or displays in which the items are purposefully arranged in patterns, we find that models that take into account perceptual grouping between items and the encoding of higher order summary information are necessary to account for human change detection performance. Considering the higher order structure of items in visual working memory will be critical for models to make useful predictions about observers' memory capacity and change detection abilities in simple displays as well as in more natural scenes.",

To overcome these limitations, we trained monkeys to perform a visual pattern separation task similar to those used in humans while recording activity from single CA3/DG neurons. We find that, when animals discriminate recently seen novel images from similar (lure) images, behavior indicative of pattern separation, CA3/DG neurons respond to lure images more like novel than repeat images. Using a population of these neurons, we are able to classify novel, lure, and repeat images from each other using this pattern of firing rates. Notably, one subpopulation of these neurons is more responsible for distinguishing lures and repeats-the key discrimination indicative of pattern separation.",

Thus, the question arises as to how the hippocampus selects and encodes features of a given stimulus. Here, we show that neurons in the hippocampus of the monkey appear to categorize types of visual stimuli presented in a delayed-match-to-sample memory task. By extracting unique combinations of features, these category cells are able to encode aspects of behaviorally important images instead of encoding all visual details. The subject is then able to rapidly select an appropriate response to that stimulus when distracting stimuli are presented simultaneously, thereby facilitating performance. Moreover, across animals, this specific type of encoding differed considerably. Just as in humans, different monkeys attended to and selected different aspects of the same stimulus image, most likely reflecting different histories, strategies, and expectations residing within individual hippocampal networks.",

We introduce DREDge (Decentralized Registration of Electrophysiology Data), a robust algorithm which is well suited for the registration of noisy, nonstationary extracellular electrophysiology recordings. In addition to estimating motion from spikes in the action potential (AP) frequency band, DREDge enables automated tracking of motion at high temporal resolution in the local field potential (LFP) frequency band. In human intraoperative recordings, which often feature fast (period <1s) motion, DREDge correction in the LFP band enabled reliable recovery of evoked potentials, and significantly reduced single-unit spike shape variability and spike sorting error. Applying DREDge to recordings made during deep probe insertions in nonhuman primates demonstrated the possibility of tracking probe motion of centimeters across several brain regions while simultaneously mapping single unit electrophysiological features. DREDge reliably delivered improved motion correction in acute mouse recordings, especially in those made with an recent ultra-high density probe. We also implemented a procedure for applying DREDge to recordings made across tens of days in chronic implantations in mice, reliably yielding stable motion tracking despite changes in neural activity across experimental sessions. Together, these advances enable automated, scalable registration of electrophysiological data across multiple species, probe types, and drift cases, providing a stable foundation for downstream scientific analyses of these rich datasets. \#\#\# Competing Interest Statement The MGH Translational Research Center has clinical research support agreements with Neuralink, Paradromics, and Synchron, for which SSC provide consultative input.

We trained monkeys to switch between three compositionally related tasks. Neural recordings found task-relevant information about stimulus features and motor actions were represented in subspaces of neural activity that were shared across tasks. When monkeys performed a task, neural representations in the relevant shared sensory subspace were transformed to the relevant shared motor subspace. Subspaces were flexibly engaged as monkeys discovered the task in effect; their internal belief about the current task predicted the strength of representations in task-relevant subspaces.

However, the population code for space did not generalize across tasks, particularly where stimuli relevant to the associative memory task appeared. Single-neuron and population-level analyses revealed that cross-task changes were due to selectivity for nonspatial features of the associative memory task when they were visually available (perceptual coding) and following their disappearance (mnemonic coding).

Here, we show that the conjunctive coding of multiple stimulus features, commonly known as nonlinear mixed selectivity, may be used by the brain to support reliable information transmission using unreliable neurons. Nonlinearly mixed feature representations have been observed throughout primary sensory, decision-making, and motor brain areas. In these areas, different features are almost always nonlinearly mixed to some degree, rather than represented separately or with only additive (linear) mixing, which we refer to as pure selectivity. Mixed selectivity has been previously shown to support flexible linear decoding for complex behavioral tasks. Here, we show that it has another important benefit: in many cases, it makes orders of magnitude fewer decoding errors than pure selectivity even when both forms of selectivity use the same number of spikes. This benefit holds for sensory, motor, and more abstract, cognitive representations. Further, we show experimental evidence that mixed selectivity exists in the brain even when it does not enable behaviorally useful linear decoding. This suggests that nonlinear mixed selectivity may be a general coding scheme exploited by the brain for reliable and efficient neural computation.",

  abstract = "Neurons in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) are typically activated by different cognitive tasks, and also by different stimuli and abstract variables within these tasks. A single neuron’s selectivity for a given stimulus dimension often changes depending on its context, a phenomenon known as nonlinear mixed selectivity (NMS). It has previously been hypothesized that NMS emerges as a result of training to perform tasks in different contexts. We tested this hypothesis directly by examining the neuronal responses of different PFC areas before and after monkeys were trained to perform different working memory tasks involving visual stimulus locations and/or shapes. We found that training induces a modest increase in the proportion of PFC neurons with NMS exclusively for spatial working memory, but not shape working memory tasks, with area 9/46 undergoing the most significant increase in NMS cell proportion. We also found that increased working memory task complexity, in the form of simultaneously storing location and shape combinations, does not increase the degree of NMS for stimulus shape with other task variables. Lastly, in contrast to the previous studies, we did not find evidence that NMS is predictive of task performance. Our results thus provide critical insights on the representation of stimuli and task information in neuronal populations, which may pave the way to a greater understanding of neural selectivity in working memory. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT How multiple types of information are represented in working memory remains a complex computational problem. It has been hypothesized that nonlinear mixed selectivity allows neurons to efficiently encode multiple stimuli in different contexts, after subjects have been trained in complex tasks. Our analysis of prefrontal recordings obtained before and after training monkeys to perform working memory tasks only partially agreed with this prediction, in that nonlinear mixed selectivity emerged for spatial but not shape information, and mostly in mid-dorsal PFC. Nonlinear mixed selectivity also displayed little modulation across either task complexity or correct performance. These results point to other mechanisms, in addition to nonlinear mixed selectivity, to represent complex information about stimulus and context in neuronal activity. \#\#\# Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest.",

  abstract = "1. To analyze the selectivity and the sparseness of firing to visual stimuli of single neurons in the primate temporal cortical visual area, neuronal responses were measured to a set of 68 visual stimuli in macaques performing a visual fixation task. The population of neurons analyzed had responses that occurred primarily to faces. The stimuli included 23 faces, and 45 nonface images of real-world scenes, so that the function of this brain region could be analyzed when it was processing natural scenes. 2. The neurons were selected to meet the previously used criteria of face selectivity by responding more than twice as much to the optimal face as to the optimal nonface stimulus in the set. Application of information theoretic analyses to the responses of these neurons confirmed that their responses contained much more information about which of 20 face stimuli had been seen (on average 0.4 bits) than about which (of 20) nonface stimuli had been seen (on average 0.07 bits). 3. The sparseness of the representation of a scene or object provided by each of these neurons (which can be thought of as the proportion of stimuli to which the neuron responds, and which is fundamental to understanding the network operation of the system) can be defined as [formula: see text] where ri is the firing rate to the ith stimulus in the set of n stimuli. The sparseness has a maximal value of 1.0. It was found that the sparseness of the representation of the 68 stimuli by each neuron had an average across all neurons of 0.65. This indicates a rather distributed representation. 4. If the spontaneous firing rate was subtracted from the firing rate of the neuron to each stimulus, so that the changes of firing rate, i.e., the responses of the neurons, were used in the sparseness calculation, then the ``response sparseness'' had a lower value, with a mean of 0.33 for the population of neurons, or 0.60 if calculated over the set of faces. 5. Multidimensional scaling to produce a stimulus space represented by this population of neurons showed that the different faces were well separated in the space created, whereas the different nonface stimuli were grouped together in the space. 6. The information analyses and multidimensional scaling provided evidence that what was made explicit in the responses of these neurons was information about which face had been seen.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

The decision-making framework of gradual information sampling toward a decision has also been proposed to apply when sampling internal sensory evidence from working memory. However, neural evidence for this proposal remains scarce. Here we show (using scalp EEG in male and female human volunteers) that sampling internal visual representations from working memory elicits a scalp EEG potential associated with gradual evidence accumulation-the central parietal positivity. Consistent with an evolving decision process, we show how this signal (1) scales with the time participants require to reach a decision about the cued memory content and (2) is amplified when having to decide among multiple contents in working memory. These results bring the electrophysiology of decision-making into the domain of working memory and suggest that variability in memory-guided behavior may be driven (at least in part) by variations in the sampling of our inner mental contents.",

However, with emerging technological capabilities, we can increasingly appreciate memory as a more dynamic and brain-wide process. In this perspective, our goal is to begin developing models to understand the gradual evolution, reorganization, and stabilization of memories across the brain after their initial formation in the hippocampus. By synthesizing studies across the rodent and human literature, we suggest that as memory representations initially form in hippocampus, parallel traces emerge in frontal cortex that cue memory recall, and as they mature, with sustained support initially from limbic then diencephalic then cortical circuits, they become progressively independent of hippocampus and dependent on a mature cortical representation. A key feature of this model is that, as time progresses, memory representations are passed on to distinct circuits with progressively longer time constants, providing the opportunity to filter, forget, update, or reorganize memories in the process of committing to long-term storage.",

In the hippocampus, but not in the amygdala, the level of WM content-selective persistent activity during WM maintenance was predictive of whether the item was later recognized with high confidence or forgotten. By contrast, visually evoked activity in the same cells was not predictive of LTM formation. During LTM retrieval, memory-selective neurons responded more strongly to familiar stimuli for which persistent activity was high while they were maintained in WM.

Here we examined how familiar faces are encoded in the IT anterior medial face patch (AM), perirhinal face patch (PR) and temporal pole face patch (TP). In AM and PR we observed that the encoding axis for familiar faces is rotated relative to that for unfamiliar faces at long latency; in TP this memory-related rotation was much weaker. Contrary to previous claims, the relative response magnitude to familiar versus unfamiliar faces was not a stable indicator of familiarity in any patch5-11. The mechanism underlying the memory-related axis change is likely intrinsic to IT cortex, because inactivation of PR did not affect axis change dynamics in AM. Overall, our results suggest that memories of familiar faces are represented in AM and perirhinal cortex by a distinct long-latency code, explaining how the same cell population can encode both the percept and memory of faces.",

One of the strongest, most synchronous neural signals produced by the hippocampus is the sharp-wave ripple (SWR), observed in a variety of mammalian species during offline behaviors, such as slow-wave sleep [1-3] and quiescent waking and pauses in exploration [4-8], leading to long-standing and widespread theories of its contribution to plasticity and memory during these inactive or immobile states [9-14]. Indeed, during sleep and waking inactivity, hippocampal SWRs in rodents appear to support spatial long-term and working memory [4, 15-23], but so far, they have not been linked to memory in primates. More recently, SWRs have been observed during active, visual scene exploration in macaques [24], opening up the possibility that these active-state ripples in the primate hippocampus are linked to memory for objects embedded in scenes. By measuring hippocampal SWRs in macaques during search for scene-contextualized objects, we found that SWR rate increased with repeated presentations. Furthermore, gaze during SWRs was more likely to be near the target object on repeated than on novel presentations, even after accounting for overall differences in gaze location with scene repetition. This proximity bias with repetition occurred near the time of target object detection for remembered targets. The increase in ripple likelihood near remembered visual objects suggests a link between ripples and memory in primates; specifically, SWRs may reflect part of a mechanism supporting the guidance of search based on past experience.",

We found that neurons in a particular area of the rhesus macaque posterior thalamus encoded the historical value memory of visual objects. Many of these value-coding neurons were located in the suprageniculate nucleus (SGN). This thalamic area directly received anatomical input from the superior colliculus (SC), and the neurons showed visual responses with contralateral preferences. Notably, the value discrimination activity of these thalamic neurons increased during learning, with the learned values stably retained even more than 200 days after learning.

Our recordings during caching revealed very sparse, transient barcode-like patterns of firing across hippocampal neurons. Each ``barcode'' uniquely represented a caching event and transiently reactivated during the retrieval of that specific cache. Barcodes co-occurred with the conventional activity of place cells but were uncorrelated even for nearby cache locations that had similar place codes. We propose that animals recall episodic memories by reactivating hippocampal barcodes.

Theta-band HPC-PFC synchrony was stronger after errors, was driven primarily by PFC to HPC directional influences and decreased with learning. In contrast, alpha/beta-band synchrony was stronger after correct trials, was driven more by HPC and increased with learning.

Critically, it is the unobserved stochastic component that is thought to confer variability in both choice and decision time. Here, we elucidate this drift-diffusion signal on individual decisions. We recorded simultaneously from hundreds of neurons in the lateral intraparietal cortex of monkeys while they made decisions about the direction of random dot motion. We show that a single scalar quantity, derived from the weighted sum of the population activity, represents a combination of deterministic drift and stochastic diffusion. Moreover, we provide direct support for the hypothesis that this drift-diffusion signal approximates the quantity responsible for the variability in choice and reaction times. The population-derived signals rely on a small subset of neurons with response fields that overlap the choice targets. These neurons represent the integral of noisy evidence. Another subset of direction-selective neurons with response fields that overlap the motion stimulus appear to represent the integrand.

Instead, we have found a considerable population of ``spatial view'' cells tuned to respond when the monkey looks at small parts of the environment. We have been able to demonstrate (1) that these hippocampal neurons respond to a view of space ``out there,'' not to the place where the monkey is; (2) that the responses depend on where the monkey is looking, by measuring eye position; (3) that the responses in some cases (e.g., CA1 but not CA3) still occur if the view details are obscured with curtains; (4) that the cells (in, e.g., CA1) retain part of their ``space'' tuning even in complete darkness, for several minutes; and (5) that the spatial representation is allocentric. The spatial representation is, thus, different from that in the rat hippocampus, in which place cells respond based on where the rat is located. The representation is also different from that described in the parietal cortex, where neurons respond in egocentric coordinates. This representation of space ``out there'' provided by primate spatial view cells would be an appropriate part of a memory system involved in memories of particular events or episodes, for example, of where in an environment an object was seen. Spatial view cells (in conjunction with whole body motion cells in the primate hippocampus, and head direction cells in the primate presubiculum) would also be useful as part of a spatial navigation system, for which they would provide a memory component.",

A new part of the theory introduced here is a quantitative analysis of how backprojections from the hippocampus to the neocortex could lead to the recall of recent memories. The theory is then compared with other theories of hippocampal function. First, what is computed by the hippocampus is considered. The hypothesis the authors advocate, on the basis of the effects of damage to the hippocampus and neuronal activity recorded in it, is that it is involved in the formation of new memories by acting as an intermediate-term buffer store for information about episodes, particularly for spatial, but probably also for some nonspatial, information. The authors analyze how the hippocampus could perform this function, by producing a computational theory of how it operates, based on neuroanatomical and neurophysiological information about the different neuronal systems contained within the hippocampus. Key hypotheses are that the CA3 pyramidal cells operate as a single autoassociation network to store new episodic information as it arrives via a number of specialized preprocessing stages from many association areas of the cerebral cortex, and that the dentate granule cell/mossy fiber system is important, particularly during learning, to help to produce a new pattern of firing in the CA3 cells for each episode. The computational analysis shows how many memories could be stored in the hippocampus and how quickly the CA3 autoassociation system would operate during recall. The analysis is then extended to show how the CA3 system could be used to recall a whole episodic memory when only a fragment of it is presented. It is shown how this recall could operate using modified synapses in backprojection pathways from the hippocampus to the cerebral neocortex, resulting in reinstatement of neuronal activity in association areas of the cerebral neocortex similar to that present during the original episode. The recalled information in the cerebral neocortex could then be used by the neocortex in the formation of long-term memories.",

  abstract = "A key question for understanding the function of the hippocampus in memory is how information is recalled from the hippocampus to the neocortex. This was investigated in a neuronal network model of the hippocampal system in which ``What'' and ``Where'' neuronal firing rate vectors were applied to separate neocortical modules, which then activated entorhinal cortex ``What'' and ``Where'' modules, then the dentate gyrus, then CA3, then CA1, then the entorhinal cortex, and then the backprojections to the neocortex. A rate model showed that the whole system could be trained to recall ``Where'' in the neocortex from ``What'' applied as a retrieval cue to the neocortex, and could in principle be trained up towards the theoretical capacity determined largely by the number of synapses onto any one neuron divided by the sparseness of the representation. The trained synaptic weights were then imported into an integrate-and-fire simulation of the same architecture, which showed that the time from presenting a retrieval cue to a neocortex module to recall the whole memory in the neocortex is approximately 100 ms. This is sufficiently fast for the backprojection synapses to be trained onto the still active neocortical neurons during storage of the episodic memory, and this is needed for recall to operate correctly to the neocortex. These simulations also showed that the long loop neocortex-hippocampus-neocortex that operates continuously in time may contribute to complete recall in the neocortex; but that this positive feedback long loop makes the whole dynamical system inherently liable to a pathological increase in neuronal activity. Important factors that contributed to stability included increased inhibition in CA3 and CA1 to keep the firing rates low; and temporal adaptation of the neuronal firing and of active synapses, which are proposed to make an important contribution to stabilizing runaway excitation in cortical circuits in the brain.",

The factors important in the pattern completion in CA3 together with a large number of independent memories stored in CA3 include a sparse distributed representation which is enhanced by the graded firing rates of CA3 neurons, representations that are independent due to the randomizing effect of the mossy fibers, heterosynaptic long-term depression as well as long-term potentiation in the recurrent collateral synapses, and diluted connectivity to minimize the number of multiple synapses between any pair of CA3 neurons which otherwise distort the basins of attraction. Recall of information from CA3 is implemented by the entorhinal cortex perforant path synapses to CA3 cells, which in acting as a pattern associator allow some pattern generalization. Pattern separation is performed in the dentate granule cells using competitive learning to convert grid-like entorhinal cortex firing to place-like fields. Pattern separation in CA3, which is important for completion of any one of the stored patterns from a fragment, is provided for by the randomizing effect of the mossy fiber synapses to which neurogenesis may contribute, by the large number of dentate granule cells each with a sparse representation, and by the sparse independent representations in CA3. Recall to the neocortex is achieved by a reverse hierarchical series of pattern association networks implemented by the hippocampo-cortical backprojections, each one of which performs some pattern generalization, to retrieve a complete pattern of cortical firing in higher-order cortical areas.",

On the basis of this hypothesis, the authors explore the computational relevance of the extrinsic afferents to the CA3 network. A quantitative statistical analysis of the information that may be relayed by such afferent connections reveals the need for two distinct systems of input synapses. The synapses of the first system need to be strong (but not associatively modifiable) in order to force, during learning, the CA3 cells into a pattern of activity relatively independent of any inputs being received from the recurrent collaterals, and which thus reflects sizable amounts of new information. It is proposed that the mossy fiber system performs this function. A second system, with a large number of associatively modifiable synapses on each receiving cell, is needed in order to relay a signal specific enough to initiate the retrieval process. This may be identified, we propose, with the perforant path input to CA3.",

Contrary to the conclusion from an earlier study (Murray and Mishkin, 1986), the present results demonstrate not only that damage limited to the rhinal cortex is sufficient to produce a severe loss in visual recognition, but also that such damage leads to a far greater loss than damage to any other single structure in the medial part of the temporal lobe.",

Thus, circumscribed bilateral lesions of the amygdala did not impair performance on 4 different memory tasks, nor did they exacerbate the memory impairment that followed hippocampal formation lesions alone. These findings suggest that one must look to structures other than the amygdala to account for the severe memory impairment that follows large lesions of the medial temporal region.

A more restricted medial temporal lobe lesion that includes the hippocampal formation and parahippocampal cortex (the H+ lesion) produces less severe memory impairment. Previous work demonstrated that extending the H+ lesion forward to include the amygdala did not exacerbate the impairment. Here, we tested the hypothesis that extending the H+ lesion forward to include the perirhinal cortex (the H++ lesion), but sparing the amygdala, should produce a more severe memory impairment and one that would approximate the level of memory impairment associated with the H+A+ lesion. Monkeys with the H++ lesion were severely impaired on two of three amnesia-sensitive tasks (delayed nonmatching to sample and delayed retention of object discrimination). On the third amnesia-sensitive task (concurrent discrimination learning), two of the monkeys in the H++ group obtained poorer scores than all seven normal monkeys, although the overall group comparison was not significant. The memory impairment following H++ damage was more severe overall than the impairment associated with the H+ lesion and approached the level of impairment associated with the H+A+ lesions. Quantitative measurement of damage in each anatomical component of the lesion indicated that the perirhinal cortex was the only brain region that was more extensively damaged in the H++ group than in the H+ group. These findings emphasize the importance of the perirhinal cortex in the anatomy of the medial temporal lobe memory system.",

The operated animals were not impaired in picture discrimination learning under either condition and they were not impaired in picture recognition memory up to about 10 seconds. At 10 seconds and beyond, however, the operated animals showed rapid deterioration of picture memory. The results demonstrate that the limbic system's selective contribution to learning and retention uncovered initially with objects applies equally to pictures, this contribution being essential for recognition memory but not for discrimination habits. The results demonstrate further that, as in humans, temporal-lobe limbic structures are essential for recognition only when the retention test exceeds the immediate memory span of a few seconds.",

Despite the ubiquity of such contextual reasoning in everyday choice, how the brain flexibly uses different valuation schemes across contexts remains unknown. We addressed this question by monitoring neural activity from the hippocampus (HPC) and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) of two monkeys performing a state-dependent choice task. We found that HPC neurons encoded state information as it became available and then, at the time of choice, relayed this information to the OFC via theta synchronization. During choice, the OFC represented value in a state-dependent manner; many OFC neurons uniquely coded for value in only one state but not the other. This suggests a functional dissociation whereby the HPC encodes contextual information that is broadcast to the OFC via theta synchronization to select a state-appropriate value subcircuit, thereby allowing for contextual reasoning in value-based choice.",

We investigated how OFC value signals interacted with ACC neurons encoding the choice response by performing simultaneous high-channel count recordings from the two areas in nonhuman primates. ACC neurons encoding the choice response steadily increased their firing rate throughout the decision-making process, peaking shortly before the time of the choice response. Furthermore, the value dynamics in OFC affected ACC ramping-when OFC represented the more valuable option, ACC ramping accelerated. Because OFC tended to represent the more valuable option more frequently and for a longer duration, this interaction could explain how ACC selects the more valuable response.",

Single unit activity was recorded with microelectrodes in monkeys performing a visual delayed matching-to-sample task. On each trial, the animal was exposed briefly to a color - the sample - and, after a period of delay, had to select the same color among two or four colors simultaneously presented. Thus, correct performance of the task required perception, retention, and recognition of the sample color for every trial. A large number of inferotemporal units were seen to react to the stimuli with changes of firing frequency. Many units showed color-dependent reactions, suggesting their involvement in perception and discrimination of colors. A substantial contingent of cells showed increased, sustained, and in some cases, color-dependent discharge during the delay which was not necessarily preceded or succeeded by firing changes in sample or match periods. It is proposed that those cells were engaged in temporary retention of the sample stimulus. Since most of the inferotemporal units examined showed firing changes in more than one period of a trial, they appeared to be involved in more than one of the operations required by the task. Thus, the data do not support a clear-cut topographic separation of visual functions within the inferotmeporal cortex. However, neurons that appear to participate in visual memory, either exclusively or in addition to other functions, are concentrated in the cortex of the lower banks of the superior temporal sulcus.",

Nearly all intended behaviour is learned and so depends on a cognitive system that can acquire and implement the 'rules of the game' needed to achieve a given goal in a given situation.

In six experiments, we show that experiences which are repeated (and, consequently, better remembered) are counterintuitively remembered as having initially occurred further away in time. This illusion is robust (amounting to as much as a 25\% distortion in perceived time), consistent (exhibited by the vast majority of participants tested), and applicable at the scale of ordinary day-to-day experience (occurring even when participants were tested over one full week). We argue that this may be one of the key mechanisms underlying why it is that people’s sense of time often strongly deviates from reality.",

In order to provide evidence on whether the inferior temporal visual cortex contains a mechanism which enables memory to span the intervening items in a serial recognition task, or whether the inferior temporal cortex is merely afferent to such recent memory mechanisms, we analysed the activity of single neurons in the inferior temporal visual cortex and the adjacent cortex in the superior temporal sulcus in both delayed match to sample and serial recognition memory tasks. In the serial recognition task, various numbers of stimuli intervened between the first and second presentations of a stimulus. A considerable proportion (64/264 or 26\%) of visually responsive inferotemporal neurons showed a different response to the ``novel'' and ``familiar'' presentations of a stimulus in the serial recognition memory task, and often a corresponding difference in response between the sample and match presentations of a stimulus in the delayed match to sample task. For the majority of neurons this difference was not sustained across even one intervening stimulus in the serial recognition task, and no neurons bridged more than 2 intervening stimuli. These results show that neurons in the inferior temporal cortex have responses which would be useful for a short term visual memory for stimuli, but would not be useful in recency memory tasks in which more than one stimulus intervenes between the first and second presentations of a stimulus. In this investigation, neurons were recorded both in the cortex on the inferior temporal gyrus (commonly called inferior temporal visual cortex, and consisting of areas TE3, TE2 and TE1 of Seltzer and Pandya 1978), and in the cortex in the adjacent anterior part of the superior temporal sulcus, in which a number of different temporal cortical visual areas have now been described.",

In the task, a trial began when the monkey pressed a lever. After a waiting period, a visual sample stimulus (S) was presented one to four times on a monitor with an interstimulus delay. Thereafter, a new stimulus (R) was presented. The monkeys were trained to remember S during the delay period and to release the lever in response to R. Colored photographs of natural objects were used as visual stimuli. 2. About 70\% of the recorded neurons (225 of 311) responded to at least one of the Ss tested. Thirty percent of these neurons (68 of 225) continued to fire during the subsequent delay periods. In 75\% of these neurons (51 of 68), the firing during the delay period strongly correlated with the response to S. 3. The discharge rate during the delay period did not correlate with the monkey's eye movements, pressing or releasing of the lever, or the reaction time. 4. If the monkey erroneously released the lever in response to S or during the delay period, the firing disappeared after the erroneous lever release. If the monkey failed to release the lever in response to R, the firing persisted even after R was withdrawn. The discharge rate in incorrect trials was comparable with that in correct trials. The neurons were considered to fire for as long as the memory of S was necessary. 5. Firing persisted even when an achromatic version or half (even a portion) of S was presented, indicating that the color, a particular portion, or the entire shape of S was not always necessary to elicit firing. 6. An S that elicited firing during the delay period invariably elicited a visual response. Neurons that fired during the delay period showed a higher stimulus selectivity than other visually responsive neurons in the anterior VMT cortex. Thus neurons that fire during the delay period represent a subgroup of visually responsive neurons that are selectively tuned to a certain stimulus. 7. More neurons fired during the delay period in the anterior VMT cortex than in the anterior IT cortex. 8. We conclude that firing during the delay period by neurons in the temporal pole reflects the short-term storage of visual information regarding a particular S.",

To investigate how the brain achieves this, in this study, we trained mice on a series of reversal learning problems that shared the same structure but had different physical implementations. Performance improved across problems, indicating transfer of knowledge. Neurons in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) maintained similar representations across problems despite their different sensorimotor correlates, whereas hippocampal (dCA1) representations were more strongly influenced by the specifics of each problem. This was true for both representations of the events that comprised each trial and those that integrated choices and outcomes over multiple trials to guide an animal's decisions. These data suggest that prefrontal cortex and hippocampus play complementary roles in generalization of knowledge: PFC abstracts the common structure among related problems, and hippocampus maps this structure onto the specifics of the current situation.",

However, recent models have suggested that its neuronal responses can be well explained by graphs, or state-spaces, that model the transitions between experiences. Here we use simulations and hippocampal recordings to reconcile these views. We show that if state-spaces are constructed compositionally from existing building blocks, or primitives, hippocampal responses can be interpreted as compositional memories, binding these primitives together. Critically, this enables agents to behave optimally in novel environments with no new learning, inferring behaviour directly from the composition. We predict a role for hippocampal replay in building and consolidating these compositional memories. Importantly, due to their compositional nature, replay can construct states the agent has never experienced - effectively building memories of the future. We test these predictions in two datasets by showing that replay events from newly discovered landmarks induce and strengthen new remote firing fields. These memories, built in replay, are compositional. When the landmark is moved, replay builds a new firing field at the same vector to the new location. Together, these findings provide a framework for reasoning about compositional memories, and demonstrate that such memories are formed in hippocampal replay.",

  abstract = "ABSTRACTRemembering events in the past is crucial to intelligent behaviour. Flexible memory retrieval, beyond simple recall, requires a cognitive map, or model of how sensations, actions, and latent environmental or task states are all related to one another. Two key brain systems are implicated in this process: the hippocampal episodic memory (EM) system and the prefrontal working memory (WM) system. While an understanding of the hippocampal system, from computation to algorithm and representation, is emerging, less is understood about how the prefrontal WM system can give rise to flexible computations beyond simple memory retrieval, and even less is understood about how the two systems relate to each other. Here we develop a mathematical theory relating the algorithms and representations of EM and WM by unveiling a duality between storing memories in synapses versus neural activity. In doing so, we develop a formal theory of the algorithms and representations of prefrontal WM in terms of structured, and controllable, neural subspaces (termed activity slots) that together can represent a dynamic cognitive map without any need for synaptic plasticity. By building models using this formalism, we elucidate the differences, similarities, and trade-offs between the hippocampal and prefrontal algorithms. Lastly, we show that several prefrontal representations in tasks ranging from list learning to cue dependent recall are unified as controllable activity slots. Our results unify frontal and temporal representations of memory, and offer a new basis for understanding dynamic prefrontal representations of WM.",

However, direct evidence of such explicit relational representations in humans is scarce, and its relationship to consolidation mechanisms is underexplored. Here, we use a graph-learning paradigm to find such a relational map in the human medial prefrontal cortex. Importantly, this representation was absent early after learning but emerged on the time scale of days.

It is suggested that there are seven distinct types of information that we derive from seen faces; these are labelled pictorial, structural, visually derived semantic, identity-specific semantic, name, expression and facial speech codes. A functional model is proposed in which structural encoding processes provide descriptions suitable for the analysis of facial speech, for analysis of expression and for face recognition units. Recognition of familiar faces involves a match between the products of structural encoding and previously stored structural codes describing the appearance of familiar faces, held in face recognition units. Identity-specific semantic codes are then accessed from person identity nodes, and subsequently name codes are retrieved. It is also proposed that the cognitive system plays an active role in deciding whether or not the initial match is sufficiently close to indicate true recognition or merely a 'resemblance'; several factors are seen as influencing such decisions. This functional model is used to draw together data from diverse sources including laboratory experiments, studies of everyday errors, and studies of patients with different types of cerebral injury. It is also used to clarify similarities and differences between processes for object, word and face recognition.",

These include the lateral and ventral surfaces of inferior temporal cortex and the upper bank, lower bank and fundus of the superior temporal sulcus (STS). Cells in the different regions may contribute in different ways to the processing of the facial image. Within the upper bank of the STS different populations of cells are selective for different views of the face and head. These cells occur in functionally discrete patches (3-5 mm across) within the STS cortex. Studies of output connections from the STS also reveal a modular anatomical organization of repeating 3-5 mm patches connected to the parietal cortex, an area thought to be involved in spatial awareness and in the control of attention. The properties of some cells suggest a role in the discrimination of heads from other objects, and in the recognition of familiar individuals. The selectivity for view suggests that the neural operations underlying face or head recognition rely on parallel analyses of different characteristic views of the head, the outputs of these view-specific analyses being subsequently combined to support view-independent (object-centred) recognition. An alternative functional interpretation of the sensitivity to head view is that the cells enable an analysis of 'social attention', i.e. they signal where other individuals are directing their attention. A cell maximally responsive to the left profile thus provides a signal that the attention (of another individual) is directed to the observer's left. Such information is useful for analysing social interactions between other individuals.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

However, these signals are not well understood, particularly in the context of the real-world challenge that the objects we search for typically appear at different positions, sizes, and within different background contexts. To investigate these signals, we recorded neural responses in IT as two rhesus monkeys performed a delayed-match-to-sample object search task in which target objects could appear at a variety of identity-preserving transformations. Consistent with the existence of behaviorally-relevant target match signals in IT, we found that IT contained a linearly separable target match representation that reflected behavioral confusions on trials in which the monkeys made errors. Additionally, target match signals were highly distributed across the IT population, and while a small fraction of units reflected target match signals as target match suppression, most units reflected target match signals as target match enhancement. Finally, we found that the potentially detrimental impact of target match signals on visual representations was mitigated by target match modulation that was approximately (albeit imperfectly) multiplicative. Together, these results support the existence of a robust, behaviorally-relevant target match representation in IT that is configured to minimally interfere with IT visual representations.",

In the macaque inferior temporal (IT) cortex, neurons mark the familiarity of a visual stimulus through response modification, often involving a decrease in spiking rate. Here, we investigate the emergence of this neural plasticity by longitudinally tracking IT neurons during several weeks of familiarization with face images. We found that most neurons in the anterior medial (AM) face patch exhibited a gradual decline in their late-phase visual responses to multiple stimuli. Individual neurons varied from days to weeks in their rates of plasticity, with time constants determined by the number of days of exposure rather than the cumulative number of presentations. We postulate that the sequential recruitment of neurons with experience-modified responses may provide an internal and graded measure of familiarity strength, which is a key mnemonic component of visual recognition.",

Repetition priming might depend on repetition suppression, a phenomenon first observed in monkey inferotemporal cortex (IT) whereby, when a stimulus is repeated, the strength of the neuronal visual response is reduced. If the reduction resulted in sharpening of the cortical representation of the stimulus, and did not just scale it down, then speeded processing might result. To explore the relation between repetition priming and repetition suppression, we monitored neuronal activity in IT while monkeys performed a symmetry decision task. We found 1) that monkeys exhibit repetition priming, 2) that IT neurons simultaneously exhibit repetition suppression, 3) that repetition priming and repetition suppression do not vary in a significantly correlated fashion across trials, and 4) that repetition suppression scales down the representation of the stimulus without sharpening it. We conclude that repetition suppression accompanies repetition priming but is unlikely to be its cause.",

Suppression is known to occur if the adapter and the test image are subtly different from each other. However, it is not known whether cross suppression occurs between images that are radically different from each other but that share a subset of features. To explore this issue, we measured repetition suppression using colored shapes. On interleaved trials, the test image might be identical to the adapter, might share its shape or color alone, or might differ from it totally. At the level of the neuronal population as a whole, suppression was especially deep when adapter and test were identical, intermediate when they shared only one attribute, and minimal when they shared neither attribute. At the level of the individual neuron, the degree of suppression depended not only on the properties of the two images but also on the preferences of the neuron. Suppression was deeper when the repeated color or shape was preferred by the neuron than when it was not. This effect might arise from feature-specific adaptation or alternatively from adapter-induced fatigue. Both mechanisms conform to the principle that the degree of suppression is determined by the preferences of the neuron.NEW \& NOTEWORTHY When an image is presented twice in rapid succession, neurons of inferotemporal cortex exhibit repetition suppression, responding less strongly to the second than to the first presentation. It has been unclear whether this phenomenon depends on the selectivity of the neuron under study.

Several mechanisms may contribute to RS in IT, such as firing rate-dependent fatigue and transsynaptic mechanisms, like synaptic depression or reduced input from neurons within the same area or from up- or downstream areas. We examined the role of firing rate fatigue and transsynaptic mechanisms by stimulating directly IT neurons using optogenetics and measured the effect of photo-stimulation on their responses using timing parameters that resulted in RS for visual stimuli. Photo-stimulation of IT neurons resulted in a marginally decreased probability of spiking activity to a subsequent photo-stimulation or to a subsequent low-contrast visual stimulus. This response reduction was small relative to that for repeated visual stimuli and was related to post-stimulation inhibition of the activity during the interval between adapter and test stimuli. Presentation of a visual adapter did not change the response to subsequent photo-stimulation. In neurons whose response to the visual adapter was inhibited by simultaneous photo-stimulation, RS to visual stimuli was unaffected. Overall, these data imply that RS in IT has a transsynaptic origin, with little or no contribution of intrinsic firing rate fatigue. In addition, they suggest a limited contribution of both local synaptic depression and reduced input from nearby IT neurons, whose responses were postulated to be decreased by firing rate fatigue, to RS in IT.",

Proposed mechanisms underlying this repetition suppression range from ``fatigue'' to top-down expectations of repetition. Here we examine a prediction from simple fatigue-based models of adaptation: prolonging adapter duration will increase the adapter response, leading to more repetition suppression. To test this, we varied adapter duration from 300 to 3000 ms, keeping the test stimulus duration constant. We observed no effect of adapter duration on repetition suppression when averaging responses across the test presentation. This was not because of a ceiling effect, since repeated presentations of a short adapter increased repetition suppression. Examination of test stimulus responses showed increased repetition suppression with longer adapter durations during the initial response phase, which reversed at a later phase. Across neurons, we found that the degree of repetition suppression covaried with the ratio of the response during the initial transient and later sustained phase of the response during the long adapter presentation, suggesting overlapping mechanisms that underlie adaptation during the adapter and the delayed test. We propose a fatigue-based account in which fatigue increases non-linearly with adapter duration to explain these unexpected findings.",

Here, we identify a link between theta-band (3-12 Hz) oscillatory activity in the hippocampus and saccadic activity in monkeys performing a recognition memory task. As monkeys freely explored novel images, saccades produced a theta-band phase reset, and the reliability of this phase reset was predictive of subsequent recognition. In addition, enhanced theta-band power before stimulus onset predicted stronger stimulus encoding. Together, these data suggest that hippocampal theta-band oscillations act in concert with active exploration in the primate and possibly serve to establish the optimal conditions for stimulus encoding.",

The cross was extinguished, and a random 600-1,000 ms thereafter, a small dot was presented for 200 ms. The dot was located either 10 degrees above, below, right, or left of the position on which the fixation cross had been. The monkey made a saccadic eye movement to this dot (in darkness). The neuronal activity around this goal-directed saccade was analyzed. In addition, control conditions were imposed systematically in which similar dots were presented, but the monkey's task was to withhold the saccade. We recorded 290 units from two monkeys. From this group, 134 met two criteria, they did not show visual response in control trials and they had spike rates >2 Hz. These were analyzed further; 53\% (71/134) showed modulation related to the target directed saccade, and 29\% (39/134) showed saccadic modulation during spontaneous eye movements. These two groups were correlated only weakly. Of the units with significant saccadic modulation, 17\% (12/71) showed significant directional selectivity, and 13\% (9/71) showed significant position selectivity (P < 0.01).

Beyond the benefit of visualizing the high-dimensional, noisy spiking activity in a compact form, such trajectories can offer insight into the dynamics of the neural circuitry underlying the recorded activity. Current methods for extracting neural trajectories involve a two-stage process: the spike trains are first smoothed over time, then a static dimensionality-reduction technique is applied. We first describe extensions of the two-stage methods that allow the degree of smoothing to be chosen in a principled way and that account for spiking variability, which may vary both across neurons and across time. We then present a novel method for extracting neural trajectories-Gaussian-process factor analysis (GPFA)-which unifies the smoothing and dimensionality-reduction operations in a common probabilistic framework. We applied these methods to the activity of 61 neurons recorded simultaneously in macaque premotor and motor cortices during reach planning and execution. By adopting a goodness-of-fit metric that measures how well the activity of each neuron can be predicted by all other recorded neurons, we found that the proposed extensions improved the predictive ability of the two-stage methods. The predictive ability was further improved by going to GPFA. From the extracted trajectories, we directly observed a convergence in neural state during motor planning, an effect that was shown indirectly by previous studies. We then show how such methods can be a powerful tool for relating the spiking activity across a neural population to the subject's behavior on a single-trial basis. Finally, to assess how well the proposed methods characterize neural population activity when the underlying time course is known, we performed simulations that revealed that GPFA performed tens of percent better than the best two-stage method.",

Substantial evidence indicates that the perirhinal cortex is involved in both the familiarity discrimination aspect of recognition memory and in perceptual functions involved with representations of complete stimuli (i.e., object identification). Published models of how the perirhinal cortex may perform familiarity discrimination can be divided into two groups. The first group assumes that a proportion of perirhinal neurons form a network specialised just for familiarity discrimination (these models may be based on Hebbian or anti-Hebbian synaptic plasticity). In contrast, the second group assumes that both familiarity discrimination and learning representations of complete stimuli are performed within a single combined network. This study establishes that when the responses of neurons that provide input to the familiarity discrimination network are correlated (as indicated by experimental data), specialised networks based on anti-Hebbian learning may recognise the previous occurrence of many more stimuli (i.e., have a capacity up to thousands of times larger) than specialised networks based on Hebbian learning. The currently published combined models do not learn an optimal stimulus representation (they do not fully extract statistically independent features), and hence their capacities are even lower than those of the specialised models based on Hebbian learning. Hence, the combined models published thus far are critically less efficient than the specialised models based on anti-Hebbian learning. This study also compares the consistency of the models with experimental observations concerning what is known of synaptic plasticity in the perirhinal cortex and the responses of its neurons. Many theoretically important parameters remain undetermined, and experiments are suggested to provide information critical for refining and distinguishing between the various models. However, the above theoretical arguments and currently published data favour the existence of a separate network specialised for familiarity discrimination.",

We find that anti-Hebbian plasticity leads to better performance than Hebbian plasticity and replicates experimental results such as repetition suppression. A combinatorial addressing function emerges, selecting a unique neuron as an index into the synaptic memory matrix for storage or retrieval.

Much is known about LTP induction in the hippocampal formation, whereas the mechanisms that regulate LTP maintenance are less understood, especially during aging. We investigated the effects of aging on MPP-CA3 LTP induction and maintenance in awake rats. As is the case in the DG and CA1, high-frequency stimulation-induced LTP at the MPP-CA3 synapse is normal in aged rats. These data indicate that N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-mediated processes are intact at the MPP-CA3 synapse in aged rats.
